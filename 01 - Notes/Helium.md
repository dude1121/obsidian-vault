# Isotopes
## Helium-2
$\ce{^2He}$, sometimes known as  *diproton*, is an extremely unstable isotope of helium. Its [[Nucleus|nucleus]] consists of only two [[Proton|protons]] and no [[Neutron|neutrons]]. Due to [[Pauli Exclusion Principle|Pauli's exclusion principle]] we know that the two protons must have opposite-aligned [[Quantum Spin|spins]]; this would cause the nucleus to have negative [[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]].

$\ce{^2He}$ is part of the first step of the [[Proton-Proton Chain|proton-proton chain]]. This step includes first two protons fusing to form diproton,
$$
\ce{^1H + ^1H + 1.25 MeV -> ^2He}
$$
which then quickly [[Beta Plus Decay|beta plus decays]] into [[Hydrogen#Hydrogen-2|deuterium]]
$$
\ce{^2He -> ^2H + e+ + \nu_{e} + 0.42 MeV}
$$
## Helium-3
$\ce{^3He}$ is the only stable isotope that contains more protons than neutrons, other than [[Hydrogen#Hydrogen-1|hydrogen-1]]. This isotope is not very abundant on Earth but is present in trace amounts. Some $\ce{^3He}$ can also be found as the result of [[Hydrogen#Hydrogen-3|tritium]] undergoing [[Beta Minus Decay|beat minus decay]]. Within [[Star|stars]], however, $\ce{^3He}$ is much more abundant as a product of [[Nuclear Fusion|nuclear fusion]]. 
## Helium-4
$\ce{^4He}$ is the most abundant isotope of helium with an abundance of $99.9998\%$. In the universe this isotope is so abundant that it is predicted to make up approximately $25\%$ of all matter by mass. This isotope is produced on Earth via other elements undergoing [[Alpha Decay|alpha decay]]. The nucleus of $\ce{^4He}$ is unusually stable because it is [[Magic Numbers (Physics)#Doubly Magic|doubly magic]], that is, its number of protons and neutrons are both magic numbers.
