# 10-002 Object
> The overall objective for grounding and bonding is to minimize the likelihood and severity of electric shock by establishing equipotentiality between exposed non-current-carrying conductive surfaces and nearby surfaces of the earth and to prevent damage to property during a fault, as follows:
> a) the objects of solidly grounding an electrical system and bonding its associated equipment is to establish a low impedance connection between the grounded conductor and the non-current-carrying conductive parts of the system to stabilize voltage.

In short, the goal of any grounding system is to minimize shock by minimizing the fault current and ensuring that conductive surfaces are at the same potential as the Earth. In a solidly grounded system, this has the added purpose of stabilizing the phase voltage by tying the voltage to the neutral line.

Impedance grounding is typically done in larger systems. Ungrounded systems are uncommon, but typically seen in delta configurated systems. One phase is shorted to ground making the other two phases usable.
# 10-004 Special Terminology
**Equipotentiality** - the state in which conductive parts are at a substantially equal electric potential.

**Impedance grounded system** - an electrical system in which a point (normally the midpoint or neutral) is connected through an impedance device
	a) to an impedance system bonding jumper; and
	b) by a grounding conductor, to a grounding electrode or to a conductive body that extends the ground connection.

**Impedance system bonding jumper** - a connection between the grounded side of an impedance grounding device and the non-current-carrying conductive parts of an electrical system.

**Separately derived system** - an electrical system in which the circuit conductors have no direct connection to the circuit conductors of a supply authority system other than those established by grounding and bonding connections.

**Solidly grounded system** - an electrical system in which a point of that system is connected, without inserting an impedance grounding device,
	a) to a system bonding jumper; and
	b) to a grounding electrode or to a conductive body that extends the ground connection.

**System bonding jumper** - a connection between the point of an electrical system to be solidly grounded and the non-current-carrying conductive parts of that electrical system.
