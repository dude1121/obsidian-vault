An **insulator** is a material that does not conduct electricity well. Insulators are typically [[Compound|compounds]] rather than single-[[Elements|elements]]. They have very high [[Resistance|resistivities]]. Valence [[Electron|electrons]] within insulators are very tightly bound to their respective [[Nucleus|nuclei]]. Examples include rubber, plastic, mica, and quartz. In various applications, insulators are sometimes referred to as [[Dielectric|dielectrics]].
