**Hydrogen** is a chemical [[Element (Chemistry)|element]] with symbol $\ce{H}$ and [[Atomic Number|atomic number]] $1$. It is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe, making up about $75\%$ of all matter. In [[Standard Temperature and Pressure|standard conditions]] hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules with formula $\ce{H_{2}}$.

# Isotopes

The most common isotope of hydrogen is $\ce{^1H}$ (sometimes called *protium*) which consists of one [[Proton|proton]] and one [[Electron|electron]]. There are two other observed isotopes, $\ce{^2H}$ (called [[Deuterium|deuterium]]) and $\ce{^3H}$ (called [[Tritium|tritium]]).
