The model for a particle's **motion under constant acceleration** is a very useful tool that allows us to model a particle's [[Motion|motion]] by giving us some relationships that hold under this condition. If [[Acceleration|acceleration]] is constant (i.e. $\dot{\mathbf{a}}=0$) and therefore the net [[Force|force]] on the particle is $0\pu{ N}$, the following relationships hold:
$$
\mathbf{v}_{f}=\mathbf{v}_{i}+\mathbf{a}t
$$
$$
\mathbf{r}_f=\mathbf{r}_{i}+\mathbf{v}t+\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}t^2
$$
$$
\mathbf{r}_{f}=\mathbf{r}_{i}+\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{v}_{i}+\mathbf{v}_{f})t
$$
$$
\mathbf{v}_{f}^2=\mathbf{v}_{i}^2+2\mathbf{a}(\mathbf{r}_{f}-\mathbf{r}_{i})
$$
Note that the final relationship allows us to find [[Position|position]], [[Velocity|velocity]], or acceleration independent of [[Time|time]]. 

This model is particularly useful for modelling free-fall motion or [[Projectile Motion|projectile motion]].

If there is no acceleration, the velocity is therefore constant and the model for [[Motion under Constant Velocity|motion under constant velocity]] can be used instead.
