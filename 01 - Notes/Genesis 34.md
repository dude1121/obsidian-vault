[[Genesis 33|Previous]] [[Genesis 35|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 2*. [[Dinah]] visits the women of the region. [[Shechem, son of Hamor]], who is also the prince of [[Shechem]], sees her and rapes her.
	- Note that the [[New Oxford Annotated Bible|NOAB]] indicates that some scholars interpret the Hebrew here to mean some sort of illicit sexual act, not necessarily rape.
- *3 - 4*. Shechem falls in love with Dinah after this and he tells his father [[Hamor]] that he wants her as his wife.
- *5 - 7*. [[Jacob]] hears of this. Hamor comes to speak to Jacob and Jacob's sons overhear the conversation and become outraged at Shechem.
	- The reason given for their outrage is not that Shechem raped Dinah necessarily, but that Shechem slept with Jacob's daughter, 'for such a thing ought not to be done.' The verse also notes that this act meant that Shechem had 'committed an outrage in Israel.' The issue here was tribal honour and perhaps purity, not Dinah's wellbeing. 
- *8 - 12*. Hamor pleads with Jacob and his sons asking for a marriage alliance. Hamor says that the land will be open to them and they would be free to live, trade, and own property within Shechem.
- *13 - 17*. The sons of Jacob lie to Hamor and say they will give Dinah to Shechem *if* Hamor has every man in Shechem circumcised. 
	- Note the shift in roles here. Whereas before it was Jacob and [[Laban]] who were the tricksters, now it is the sons of Jacob.
- *18 - 23*. Hamor and Shechem report back to the men of the city. They say that Jacob's camp (which must have been quite large at this point for this to be a matter for the whole city) would be willing to live, do business, etc. in Shechem so long as they are all circumcised.
	- Hamor's tone is different here than when he spoke to Jacob, though. Here, it seems Hamor seeks to assimilate Jacob's camp into Shechem through intermarrying with them.
- *24*. To be fair, they follow through, and every man in the city is circumcised.
- *25 - 26*. Two of Jacob's sons, [[Levi (Person)|Levi]] and [[Simeon (Person)|Simeon]], kill all the men in the city. Evidently this was not part of the brothers' plan as a whole, since only these two actually kill the men in the city.
	- Verse 26 also states that they kill Hamor and Shechem and then bring Dinah out of Shechem's house, which means, if she really was raped, the brothers just let her go back with her rapist immediately.
- *27 - 29*. The rest of the brothers come in and loot the city, stealing flocks and other valuables in Shechem, including women and children.
	- In a literary sense, this is a reversal of the plan the Shechemites had for them, to steal their women and children. But with a modern lens, these women have clearly been stolen as sex slaves. A theme that will occur again and again throughout the [[Pentateuch]].
- *30*. Jacob rebukes Simeon and Levi, saying that they have brought trouble on him by making him 'odious to the inhabitants of the land.' Jacob worries that others will hear of this and attack Jacob's family.
- *31*. The brothers, for their part, raise a good question. Is the threat of other nations wiping out Jacob a good enough excuse to allow Dinah to be treated that way?
# Thoughts
It is kind of comedic that Simeon and Levi waited until all the men had been circumcised before attacking and killing them anyways.

This chapter is altogether incredibly frustrating, especially as a modern reader. Dinah is given no agency at all, and we don't even see her do anything herself this chapter. Everything that occurs with Dinah happens *to* her. Then, of course, there is the detail about whether or not Dinah was raped and if that is what the author of this chapter meant. 

If Dinah was raped, then the treatment of her by her own family is appalling. None of them are upset that she was assaulted, only that the family name was disgraced. After they speak to Hamor and Shechem, they even let Dinah go back with Shechem before she is taken back to her family after they slaughter the city. 

If Dinah was not raped, and her relationship with Shechem was consensual, then her family are controlling, feeling that they deserved to say who she could and could not be with, without ever consulting her about it. Then, when she does get to be with the person she wants to be with, three days later her brothers come and kill the guy. Either way, this story does not end well for Dinah, or any women, really.
## Blessing of Simeon and Levi
This chapter really seems to be a justification as to why the tribes of [[Simeon (Tribe)|Simeon]] and [[Levi (Tribe)|Levi]] are given 'lesser' blessings than the other 10. Even though the rest of the brothers join in on the pillaging, it is Simeon and Levi who are singled out and receive punishment for it in [[Genesis 49|chapter 49]].
## How Israel acquired Shechem
The city of Shechem goes on to become the capital of the [[Israel (Northern Kingdom)|Northern Kingdom of Israel]]. This makes this story's setting not just *any* city, but the capital, the most important city, for the northern kingdom. In [[Genesis 33|the previous chapter]], Jacob is said to have purchased land in Shechem for 100 qesitah. In this chapter, Jacob and his sons inherit Shechem by massacring its residents. In *[[Who Wrote the Bible?]]*, Friedman argues that the *Jahwist* source (see [[Documentary Hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]]) wrote chapter 34 to explain the [[Kingdom of Judah|southern kingdom's]] view as to how Israel inherited Shechem, whereas the *Elohist* source wrote the end to chapter 33 to explain the northern view of how Israel got the city.
