The **Magnetomotive force** (mmf) is an applied force generated by a [[Solenoid|solenoid]]. The magnitude of mmf is given by,
$$
\mathcal{F}=NI
$$
where $N$ is the number of turns in the solenoid and $I$ is the current through the solenoid. It is the [[Magnetic Circuit|magnetic circuit]] equivalent to [[Electromotive Force|emf]].
