A **solid** is a [[State of Matter|state of matter]] defined by closely packed together molecules that give a solid [[Structural Rigidity|structural rigidity]] (see [[Rigid Body|rigid body]]) and resistance to a [[Force|force]] applied to the surface. Unlike [[Liquid|liquids]], solids do not take the shape of their container nor do they expand to fill the entire available volume like a [[Gas|gas]].

Very broadly, solids can be split into two categories: [[Amorphous Solid|amorphous]] (meaning 'without shape') and [[Crystalline Solid|crystalline]]. Crystalline solids are solids with a highly regular arrangement of their components and amorphous solids have much more disorder in their structures.
