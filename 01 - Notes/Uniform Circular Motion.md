**Uniform circular motion** is a model for describing the [[Motion|motion]] of a particle travelling in a circular path at a constant [[Speed|speed]]. It is important to remember that the *speed* is constant, but the linear [[Velocity|velocity]] is not, since the particle's direction is constantly changing, due to its [[Acceleration|acceleration]].

An object travelling in a circle experiences a [[Centripetal|centripetal]] acceleration, meaning its acceleration [[Vector|vector]] points to the centre of the circle in which the particle is travelling. This acceleration is given by,
$$
a_{c}=\frac{v^2}{r}
$$
where $a_{c}$ is the centripetal acceleration, $v$ is the speed (or magnitude of the particle's velocity), and $r$ is the radius of the circle. Since the particle is experiencing an acceleration, we can also find the net [[Force|force]] the particle experiences.
$$
\sum F=ma_{c}
$$
Since $a_{c}=\frac{v^2}{r}$,
$$
\sum F=m\frac{v^2}{r}
$$
If the acceleration is not constant or the particle's speed varies, the particle is instead in [[Nonuniform Circular Motion|nonuniform circular motion]].
