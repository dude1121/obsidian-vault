An **induction machine** is an [[Electrical Machine|electrical machine]] that can be run as either a [[Generator|generator]] or a [[Motor|motor]], but is more frequently encountered as a motor. An induction machine can be either single phase or three phase, but always runs off of [[AC Electricity|ac electricity]]. Speed in induction machines is frequency-dependent which means that speed control is only possible through [[Variable Frequency Drive|VFDs]] and other solid state solutions. The two most common forms of induction machines, whether single or three phase, is the *squirrel cage* machine or the *wound-rotor* machine.

# Single Phase Induction Motors

Single phase ($1-\Phi$) induction machines are among the most common of all electric motors and are found in many appliances and power tools. They are typically employed when $3-\Phi$ power is not available or practical.

## Construction

$1-\Phi$ induction motors are constructed very similarly to $3-\Phi$ motors. They are composed of a squirrel-cage rotor and a stator. The stator has a *main winding* which generates a set of north and south [[Magnetic Pole|magnetic poles]], as well as an *auxiliary winding* that operates only during start-up. The auxiliary winding has the same number of poles as the main winding. These windings are lodged straddling the main windings.

## Speed

$1-\Phi$ motors have their synchronous speed defined the same as $3-\Phi$ motors. That is,
$$
n_{s}=\frac{120f}{p}
$$
Just like $3-\Phi$ motors, $1-\Phi$ motors will operate at just below synchronous speed, typically with a slip anywhere between 3 - 5%.
