**RMS** or **root mean square** is, as it sounds like, the [[Square Root]] of a set's [[mean]] square. That is, to find the rms value for a set, square all values in the set, take the average value, and then take the square root of that value. 

# Electrical Engineering

Rms values are typically used in [[AC Electricity|ac electric circuits]] where an alternating current or voltage is represented using its rms value instead of the wave equation that represents that value. The rms value of a voltage or current can be found by,
$$
V_{rms}=V_{pk}\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\approx 0.707V_{pk}
$$
If the waveform has a dc offset, then the rms value is given by,
$$
V_{rms}=\sqrt{ V_{dc}^2+V_{ac}^2 }
$$
