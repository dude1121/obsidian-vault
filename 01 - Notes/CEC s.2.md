# Section 2 — General Rules
# Administrative
## 2-030 Deviation or postponement
> In any case where deviation or postponement of these Rules and regulations is necessary, special permission shall be obtained before proceeding with the work, but this special permission shall apply only to the particular installation for which it is given.
# Technical: General
## 2-100 Marking of equipment
> 1) Each piece of electrical equipment shall bear those of the following markings necessary to identify the equipment and ensure that it is suitable for the particular installation:
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>a) the maker's name, trademark, or other recognized symbol of identification; 
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>b) catalogue number or type;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>c) voltage;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>d) rated load amperes;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>e) watts, volt amperes, or horsepower;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>f) whether for ac, dc, or both;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>g) number of phases;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>h) frequency in hertz;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>i) rated load speed in revolutions per minute;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>j) designation of terminals;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>k) whether for continuous or intermittent duty;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>l) short-circuit current rating or withstand rating;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>m) evidence of approval; or
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>n) other markings necessary to ensure safe and proper operation.
> 2) At the time of installation, each service box shall be marked in a conspicuous, legible, and permanent manner, to indicate clearly the maximum rating of the overcurrent device that may be used for this installation.
> 3) At each distribution point, circuit breakers, fuses, and switches shall be marked, adjacent thereto, in a conspicuous and legible manner to indicate clearly
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>a) which installation or portion of installation they protect or control; and
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>b) the maximum rating of overcurrent device that is permitted.
>  4) Where feeders or branch circuits are added, removed, or modified at an existing panelboard, the marking required by Subrule 3) shall be updated.
>  5) Where the maximum continuous load allowed on a fused switch or circuit breaker as determined in accordance with [[CEC s.8#8-104 Maximum circuit loading|Rule 8-104]] 5) and 6) is less than the continuous operating marking of the fused switch or circuit breaker, a permanent, legible caution marking shall be field applied adjacent to the fused switch or circuit breaker nameplate to indicate the maximum continuous loading permitted for connection to the fused switch or circuit breaker.
>  6) Where the ampacity of the conductors for a service or feeders based on the loads calculated in accordance with [[CEC s.8#8-200 Single Dwellings|Rule 8-200]] or [[CEC s.8#8-202 Apartment and similar buildings|8-202]] are less than the rating of the fuse or circuit breaker, a permanent, legible caution marking shall be field applied adjacent to the fused switch or circuit breaker nameplate to indicate the maximum load permitted.
>  7) The marking on electrical equipment shall not be added to, or changed, to indicate a use under this Code for which the equipment has not been approved.
## 2-110 Circuit voltage-to-ground — Dwelling units
> Branch circuits in dwelling units shall not have a voltage exceeding $150$ volts-to-ground except that, where the calculated load on the service conductors of an apartment or similar building exceeds $250\ \mathrm{kVA}$ and where qualified electrical maintenance personnel are available, higher voltages not exceeding the voltage-to-ground of a nominal system voltage of $600\mathrm{Y}/347\ \mathrm{V}$ shall be permitted to be used in the dwelling unit to supply the following fixed (not portable) equipment:
> a) space heating, provided that wall-mounted thermostats operate at a voltage not exceeding $300$ volts-to-ground;
> b) water heating; and
> c) air conditioning.
# Maintenance and operation
## 2-316 Receptacles required for maintenance of equipment
> Where heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and similar equipment is installed on a rooftop other than at a dwelling unit, at least one receptacle shall be
> 	a) provided for the maintenance of this equipment; and
> 	b) installed in accordance with [[CEC s.26#26-710 Receptacles for maintenance of equipment located on rooftops|Rule 26-710]].
