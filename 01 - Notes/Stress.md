**Stress** is a quality of an object that is proportional to the [[Force|force]] applied that causes a [[Elasticity in Solids|deformation]]. It is the applied force per unit cross-sectional [[Area|area]]. The result of stress is [[Strain|strain]]. Stress is typically defined as
$$
\sigma=\frac{F}{A}
$$
but should not be confused with [[Pressure|pressure]], which is also force over area.
