**Russian Populism** was a political movement in [[Russian Empire|the Russian Empire]]. It was named such retrospectively and was the mainstream radical political belief in Russia from the 1860s to 1880s. 

The populists believed that the rapid industrialization of Europe[^1] had, instead of benefiting its people, only led to human degradation, mass impoverishment, and destruction of the so-called "social fabric" of Western society. They felt that this industrialization needed to be avoided in Russia if it were to survive.

Populists saw that capitalism had had a destructive impact on the rural communities, forcing predominately agrarian peasants into cities, transforming them into landless, oppressed workers. In other words, the peasantry was becoming what would be called the [[Proletariat|proletariat]]. As such the populists wished to preserve the current order, the *mir* system, because "they believed that the *mir* was an egalitarian institution<span>&mdash;</span>perhaps a survival of primitive [[Communism|communism]]<span>&mdash;</span>through which Russia might find a separate path to socialism" (Fitzpatrick, 25). 
# Going to the peoples
In the early 1870s the populists and the [[Intelligentsia|intelligentsia]] class as a whole had became increasingly frustrated with their own situation as well as the situation of their brethren: the peasants. Therefore in 1873-1874 the populists conducted the "going to the peoples," an attempt to reach out to the peasantry for various reasons. Some intended to enlighten the peasantry to their plight, others seeking to acquire wisdom from them, and some others hoping to radicalize the peasant class. There was no central idea behind the movement, no clearly defined objective, yet the authorities saw it as a threat to Tsarist autocracy and promptly arrested masses of these populists. As for the peasants themselves they did not know the people who were vacating the cities to come to their villages, nor did they trust them. Many peasants gave them up to the authorities who were looking for them.

This failure of the going to the peoples left many populists disappointed, some even angry. Later in the same decade, populist terrorism increased, some due to their desire to see their imprisoned comrades freed, others hoping to dismantle the Tsar's regime. 
# The People's Will
In 1879, a small group of populists formed a revolutionary group known as *narodnaya volya* (Народная воля)<span>&mdash;</span>People's Will. This group was a self-proclaimed terrorist group with aims of pressuring the government into reform, which would in turn incite a mass peasant uprising. Although being [[Socialism|socialist]], the group opposed [[Marxism]] in favour of [[Anarchism|anarchism]]. 

In 1881, the group successfully assassinated Tsar [[Alexander II]] by tossing a bomb at his carriage (which failed to kill the Tsar due to his bulletproof carriage) followed by a second bomb tossed at his feet. He died on March 1, 1881[^2]. The purpose of this assassination was not for the next Tsar, [[Alexander III]], to institute liberal reforms, but rather to crack down on the Russian people, creating something akin to a police state. The hope was that if the government was reactionary enough it would force the peoples into revolt.
# Fate
The populist movement in Russian eventually fragmented into different groups. The more radical populists, the People's Will types, would go on to form and inspire other socialist and anarchist groups, including the Russian [[Russian SRs|Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries]], or, as they would later be known, the *SRs*.
