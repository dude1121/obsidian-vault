**Hysteresis** is the dependence of the state of a system based on its history. It is found in many different fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering. 

# Magnetic Hysteresis

A typical magnetic hysteresis curve (or B-H curve) looks as shown below.

This compares the magnetizing force $H$ versus the [[Magnetic Flux|magnetic flux density]] $B$. This shows that for virgin material (material that has never been previously magnetized), placing the material in a magnetic field will result in the flux density growing until the object is saturated. When the field is removed, however, it does not follow the same path down, instead going from point $b$ to point $c$, which is called the *residual magnetism*, since it is magnetism left over after the $H$ field was removed.
