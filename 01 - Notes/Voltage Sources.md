A **voltage source** is anything that provides [[Voltage|voltage]] to an electrical circuit. This may in the the form of [[DC Electricity|DC]] or [[AC Electricity|AC]] voltage sources. An example of an ac voltage source is the output of a [[Generator|generator]] or from an ac [[Receptacle|receptacle]], and a dc voltage source may be from a [[Battery|battery]] or rectified ac output.

We typically use $E$ to denote a voltage source, since it is a *source* of voltage, not a voltage *drop* (where $V$ would be used instead). In the circuit above, the symbol for a battery is shown, indicating this is a [[Series Circuits|series dc circuit]].

In an [[Series AC Circuits|ac circuit]], the voltage source symbol changes to reflect its sinusoidal nature. 

# Independent and Dependent Sources

Voltage sources can either be independent or dependent. An independent voltage source is like the sources above, a battery, ac receptacle, etc. It's voltage is not dependent on any other component. A dependent source can vary depending on some other external force. Dependent voltage sources can either be voltage-controlled (VCVS) or current-controlled (CCVS) and can of course be either dc or ac.

Dependent sources are typically depicted as a diamond with either a plus and minus to indicate dc current directionality,

or a sinusoid to indicated a dependent ac voltage source.
