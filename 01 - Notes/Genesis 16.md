[[Genesis 15|Previous]] [[Genesis 17|Next]]
# Summary
- *2*. [[Sarah|Sarai]] tells [[Abraham|Abram]] to conceive a child with [[Hagar]] since she is unable to conceive.
- *4*. Hagar is not as submissive to Sarai anymore and Sarai becomes angry.
- *6*. Sarai sends Hagar away.
- *9*. An [[Angel|angel]] tells Hagar to return to Sarai.
- *10*. A similar promise of multiplying offspring is given to Hagar.
- *12*. Since [[Islam|muslims]] believe that [[Ishmael]] is the ancestor of [[Muhammad]], this verse fits well.
- *13*. This verse is translated differently in each translation but the consensus seems to be that Hagar calls the god she is speaking to 'El-roi.' Likely though, this is still [[Yahweh]] speaking here.
- *14*. The well at which this occurs is known as Beer-lahai-roi, meaning 'the well of the Living One who sees me.'
- *16*. Abram was 86 years old when Ishmael was born, therefore Ishmael is born 2034 years after Adam (see timeline [[Genesis 11|here]]).
# Thoughts
I think it would be interesting to do more research on Islam and the lineage from Ishmael to Muhammad.

This story of Hagar being cast out is repeated, albeit under different circumstances, but yet again we see the use of motifs repeated, as later in [[Exodus]] the [[Ancient Israel|nation of Israel]] will be cast out and 'meet God' in the desert. It is a good literary device, but it is odd to have this in a 'divinely inspired' historical text.
