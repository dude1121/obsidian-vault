# Section 4 — Conductors
# 4-008 Induced voltages and currents in metal armour or sheaths of single-conductor cables
> 1) Where sheath currents in single-conductor cables having continuous sheaths of lead, aluminum, stainless steel, or copper are likely to cause the insulation of the conductors to be subjected to temperatures in excess of the insulation ratings, the cables shall be 
> 	a) derated to 70% of the current-carrying rating that would otherwise apply;
> 	b) derated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and in compliance with [[CEC s.2#2-030 Deviation or postponement|Rule 2-030]]; or
> 	c) installed in a manner that prevents the flow of sheath currents.
> 2) Circulating currents in single-conductor armoured cable shall be treated in the same manner as sheath currents in Subrule 1).
> 3) Single-conductor cables and single insulated conductors carrying more than $200\ \mathrm{A}$ shall not enter ferrous metal boxes through individual openings.
> 4) Where single-conductor cables and single insulated conductors carrying more than $200\ \mathrm{A}$ enter ferrous metal boxes, precautions shall be taken to prevent overheating of the wall of the box by induction.
> 5) Precautions to be taken to prevent overheating of the metal shall include the use of non-ferrous or non-metallic box connectors or cable glands, locknuts, bushings, and ground bushings.
> 6) All cables and insulated conductors making up a circuit shall enter the box through one common non-ferrous or insulating plate having a minimum thickness of $6.0\ \mathrm{mm}$ unless a deviation is allowed in accordance with [[CEC s.2#2-030 Deviation or postponement|Rule 2-030]].
> 7) Where single-conductor mineral-insulated cables are used, all current-carrying conductors shall be grouped together to minimize induced voltage on the sheath.
# 4-020 Common neutral conductor
> Provided that when in metal enclosures all conductors of feeder circuits employing a common neutral are contained within the same enclosure, a common neutral shall be permitted to be employed for
> 	a) two or three sets of 3-wire, single-phase feeders; or
> 	b) two sets of 4-wire, three-phase feeders

That is, *all conductors must be in the same metal enclosures*. For [[Light Fixture|lighting]] circuits, shared neutrals are considered to be [[Current|current]]-carrying.
