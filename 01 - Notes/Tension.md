**Tension** is a pulling or stretching [[Force|force]] applied along some object such as a string, rope, or chain. It is the opposite of [[Compression|compression]]. Tension is often denoted with $\mathbf{\vec{T}}$ and, being a force, it is measured in [[Newton|newtons]]. Tension is a result of [[Newton's Laws|Newton's third law]], since applying some force on an object in a pulling motion causes an equal but opposite force in the object itself that opposes the applied force. 

If a given object like a rope experiences a sufficient force of tension, it may break. The amount that an object is able to withstand tension is calculated using [[Young's Modulus|Young's modulus]].
