A **lattice** is a periodic arrangement of particles within a [[Crystalline Solid|crystalline solid]]. The lattice is a three dimensional [[Array|array]] made up of many _lattice points_. These points can be translated some distance $a_{1}$ and a distance $b_{1}$ to make up a two-dimensional lattice, and a third noncolinear translation produces a three-dimensional lattice. These directions do _not_ need to be perpendicular to one another.

Since the lattice is periodic, we can break it down into [[Unit Cell|unit cells]] to analyze it easier. The unit cell is a fundamental unit that is repeated throughout the lattice, but importantly it is not _unique_. Within the same lattice there are different possibilities for how the unit cell may be described, as seen below. Unit cells $C$ and $D$ could be repeated to re-create the lattice.

A _primitive cell_ is the smallest unit cell that can be repeated to form the lattice. In many cases, however, it is more convenient to use a unit cell that is not a primitive cell. 

We can describe a unit cell as a vector $\vec{r}$ where,
$$
\vec{r}=p\vec{a}+q\vec{b}+s\vec{c}
$$
where $p,\ q,\ r \in \mathbb{Z}$. Since the locations are arbitrary, we can restrict $p$, $q$, and $s$ to being positive integers for simplicity. The magnitudes of $\vec{a}$, $\vec{b}$, and $\vec{c}$ are the lattice constants of the cell.
