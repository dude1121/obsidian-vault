# Capacitors
## 26-208 Conductor size for capacitors
### 1)
>The ampacity of capacitor feeder circuits and branch circuits shall not be less than $135\%$ of the rated current of the capacitor.
### 2)
> Where a branch circuit supplies two or more capacitors, the overcurrent device protecting the conductors of the branch circuit shall be considered as protecting the taps made thereto to supply single capacitors, provided that
> 		a) the tap is not more than $7.5\ \pu{ m}$ long; and
		  b) its conductors comply with subrule 1) and also have an ampacity not less than one-third that of the branch circuit conductors from which they are supplied.
## 26-210 Overcurrent protection
> An overcurrent device, rated or set as low as practicable without causing unnecessary opening of the circuit, but not exceeding $250\%$ of the rated current of the capacitor, shall be provided in each ungrounded conductor of a capacitor feeder or branch circuit, unless a deviation has been allowed in accordance with Rule [[CEC s.26#2-030 Deviation or postponement|2-030]].

Both [[Circuit Breaker|circuit breakers]] and [[Fuse|fuses]] can not exceed $250\%$ of the rated capacitor current.
## 26-212 Disconnecting means for capacitor feeders or branch circuits
### 1)
> A disconnecting means shall be provided in each ungrounded conductor connected to each capacitor bank in order that the capacitors can be made dead without having to disconnect other loads.
### 2)
> The disconnecting means shall be within sight of and not more than $9\ \pu{ m}$ from the capacitor unless the disconnecting means can be locked in the open position.
### 3)
> A warning notice shall be affixed to the disconnecting means used on circuits having capacitors only, stating that
> 		a) the circuit has capacitors; and
		  b) a waiting period of $5\ \pu{ min}$ is necessary when the circuit is opened, after which the capacitors shall be discharged before handling.
