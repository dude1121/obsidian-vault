# 1. The Long Fuse
> The weather was indeed fine, but thinking men and women were aware that Europe lived on a powder keg, and had for years. (p. 11)
- Factors contributing to [[World War I|WWI]]:
	- Population explosion in Europe.
		- "ushered in by new developments in agriculture and more especially in medicine"
		- At the beginning of 19th century European population ~ 50 million. In 1820, ~ 100 million. By 1870, 200 million. By 1914, 300 million.
	- Larger population led to more industrialization.
		- [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial revolution]] spread to continental Europe after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]
		- Broadly speaking this meant "increased amenities for larger numbers or alternatively increased frustration for those who believed they were one way or another kept from receiving their fair share."
		- These frustrations over inequality led to thinkers like [[Karl Marx]]. [[Socialism|Socialists]] and [[Communism|Communists]] vied with each other. [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] also appeared on the scene. The optimism of [[John Locke]] and [[Rene Descartes]] gave way to the "dark uncertainties" of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].
	- [[Nationalism]] also becomes largely popular at this time.
		- "So intense was nationalism that the states or powers were inevitably spoken of as if they were individual persons$~-~$because a sense of national self-satisfaction was achieved only at the expense of another nation."
		- This also ties into beliefs like [[Social Darwinism]]. 
	- Along with nationalism, [[Militarism]] also sees a rise.
		- This leads to young men yearning for war, largely because they themselves had never fought in one. The last large scale European war was in 1815. 
		- Since then there had been skirmishes between individual countries (e.g. the [[Crimean War]] in 1853-1856, the second war of Italian independence between France and Austria in 1859, and most notably, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870-1871 which resulted in a resounding German victory)
		- All these wars had been short, though. Or, if not short, they were distant, colonial wars, that the everyday European paid little attention to.
		- Two things change that: technology, and an "interlocking system of alliance".
## Technological advances
- Some advances were not explicitly militaristic. Barbed wire, for example, was invented in the United States to control cattle, but it found an alternate use on the battlefield in trenches.
- Other advances were definitely militaristic but their impacts were underestimated. Take the machine gun for example. In the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in the early 1900s, European spectators remarked "the machine gun is a vastly overrated weapon; it appears highly doubtful that it would be effective against trained European soldiery." 
- Previous wars had been won essentially by the side that could mobilize their army the quickest. Therefore at the turn of the century, focus was more on mobilization efficiency rather than combat efficiency. It didn't matter if your soldiers were bad, if they got to the battlefield first, they thought, it would be an easy victory.
- These generals believed offense was what won wars, but the technological advancements made like barbed wire, machine guns, and artillery had given a major advantage to the defender, not the aggressor. 
- Since previous wars had been much shorter, the strategies of rapid mobilization and quick fighting were less effective, since as the war continued, battle fatigue quickly set in among soldiers who had never expected to fight as long as they had.
## Alliance system
- After the Franco-Prussian war, [[Otto von Bismarck]], the chancellor of the newly unified Germany made it his aim to isolate France as much as possible. Germany sought an alliance with both Austria, a nation Germany had also recently defeated, and Russia. These three made up the *Three Emperors' League* and it lasted for about a decade. This could never last, however, as Russian and Austrian ambitions in the [[The Balkans|Balkans]] were incompatible. Bismarck improved Germany's ties with Austria rather than Russia, and in 1882 they signed the *Dual Alliance*, shortly thereafter including Italy to form the *Triple Alliance*.
	- However, Russia does not formally leave their alliance with Germany until 1888 when Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] ascends to the German throne and dismisses Bismarck.
- As soon as Russia is no longer tied to Germany, France seeks an alliance. They send funds to help Russia industrialize, primarily to fund the construction of Russian railroads. These two countries increased relations, having state visits back and forth, and by 1893, just three years after being cast out by Germany, Russia and France are practically allied.
