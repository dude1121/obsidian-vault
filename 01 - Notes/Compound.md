In chemistry, a **compound** is a collection of [[Atom|atoms]]. Importantly, a compound must contain more than one [[Element (Chemistry)|element]] to be considered a compound. A [[Molecule|molecule]] of only one element like [[Oxygen|oxygen]] $\ce{O_{2}}$ is therefore not a compound. There are four main types of compounds:

- Molecular compounds (molecules) are held together with [[Covalent Bond|covalent bonds]]
- [[Ionic Compound|Ionic compounds]] (Salts) are held together with [[Ionic Bond|ionic bonds]]
- [[Intermetallic Compound|Intermetallic compounds]] are held by [[Metallic Bond|metallic bonds]]
- [[Coordination Complex|coordination complexes]] are held by [[Coordinate Covalent Bonds|coordinate covalent bonds]]
