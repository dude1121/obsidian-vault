According to the [[Canadian Electrical Code|CEC]], **bonding** is a defined as
>[!quote] Bonding
>a low impedance path obtained by permanently joining all non-current-carrying metal parts to ensure electrical continuity and having the capacity to conduct safely any current likely to be imposed on it.

This concept is similar to, but distinct from, [[Grounding|grounding]]. Put generally, bonding is for things that are not intended to carry [[Current|current]] whereas grounding is for things that are. Within the CEC, bonding is covered in [[CEC s.10|section 10]].
