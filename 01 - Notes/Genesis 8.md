[[Genesis 7|Previous]] [[Genesis 9|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. Echoes [[Genesis 1|Gen 1.2]] with a wind blowing across the waters.
- *13 - 19*. [[Noah]] and his family and the animals leave the [[Noah's Ark|ark]].
- *17*. Echoes Gen 1.28.
- *20*. Now Noah uses the surplus clean animals as a sacrifice.
- *21*. God promises to not curse the ground again nor will he destroy every creature again. This fulfilled [[Lamech|Lamech's]] naming of him.
	- But, we also see that God now views the inclination of all humans is 'evil from youth.'
# Thoughts
I never really noticed the re-creation parallels between Genesis 8 and Genesis 1. 

God's promise to not kill every living creature again comes only after the sacrifice. If God had originally intended to once again cause something like the flood, why save Noah in the first place?

The idea that God views human hearts as evil is interesting because JWs never mention this point. God essentially said he wouldn't destroy humans again because it is in our nature to be wicked. But if we're made in God's image, what does that say about him?
