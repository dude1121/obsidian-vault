An **OLED** (**O**rganic **L**ight **E**mitting **D**iode) is a special type of [[LED]] that makes use of organic (containing [[Carbon|carbon]]) materials to emit [[Light|light]].

# Construction

OLEDs consist of two or three layers of organic materials. They produce light via [[Electrophosphorescence|electrophosphorescence]].

When a voltage is applied across the anode and cathode, the resulting current provides [[Electron|electrons]] to the emissive layer by removing them from the conductive layer. This removal leaves [[Hole Current|holes]] in the conductive layer, with which free electrons within the emissive layer can recombine. When this recombination occurs, energy in the form of light is released that passes through the transparent cathode layer. If the anode and substrate are also made transparent, the light passes through these as well. This can make OLEDs useful in applications like heads-up displays.

# Applications

Due to their nature, OLEDs are able to be sprayed onto the surface of some substrates, similar to how ink is sprayed onto paper in an inkjet printer. This makes making large displays like 80-inch TV screens or billboards much more affordable than with other materials. 

OLEDs are typically used in making displays, although the fact that OLEDs are more [[Efficiency|efficient]] than standard LEDs means that OLEDs might be used more in lighting applications.
