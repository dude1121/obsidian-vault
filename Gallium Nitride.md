**Gallium nitride** (GaN) is a [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]] compound of [[Gallium|gallium]] and [[Nitrogen|nitrogen]]. It is commonly used in blue [[LED|LEDs]]. It can also be combined with [[Indium Nitride|indium nitride]] (InN) to form [[Indium Gallium Nitride|indium gallium nitride]] (InGaN), another semiconductor material commonly used in LEDs. Gallium nitride has a [[Band Gap|band gap]] of ~$3.4\pu{ eV}$, making it especially useful in high-power and high-frequency applications. GaN is able to produce violet [[Light|light]] ($\lambda=405\pu{ nm}$). 

Gallium nitride [[Transistor|transistors]] are able to perform at much higher [[Temperature|temperatures]] and higher [[Voltage|voltages]] than [[Gallium Arsenide|gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) transistors, making GaN transistors perfect for use in amplifiers at [[Microwave|microwave]] [[Frequency|frequencies]].
