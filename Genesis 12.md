[[Genesis 11|Previous]] [[Genesis 13|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. God tells [[Abraham|Abram]] to leave.
- *2*. Abram will become a great nation.
- *4*. [[Lot]] leaves with Abram. Abram is 75, meaning they leave in the year 2023 AA.
- *5*. Abram takes his family, as well as "the persons whom \[he] had acquired," thereby indication Abram owned slaves and is the first to be mentioned as having slaves.
- *6*. "At that time the [[Canaan|Canaanites]] were in the land." This implies that when this was written, the Canaanites were no longer in the land. If Moses did write this, wouldn't the Canaanites *still be there*, since [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] had not conquered the promised land yet?
- *7*. God promises land of Shechem to Abram.
- *10 - 16*. Abram tells [[Sarah|Sarai]] to say she is his sister, not wife, for fear the Egyptians will kill Abram to take Sarai from him. In verses 1 - 3 God promised to protect Abram, so why did he feel the need to turn to deceit to protect himself?
- *17 - 20*. [[Pharaoh]] sends Abram and Sarai out of Egypt because God inflicts plagues on him. This story echoes the later exodus out of Egypt with plagues, followed by Pharaoh telling God's people to go.
# Thoughts
The promise made to Abram seemed to be lost on him, as he immediately seems to try to fix the situation on his own.

The parallels between this account and the Israelite exodus seem to indicate more re-occuring motifs.

The [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]] renders verse 19 as "...so that I was _about to take_ her as my wife," which they claim is due to the verb being in the imperfective aspect. This is plausible, and will require more research once I have a Hebrew Bible. [[King James Version|KJV]] seems in harmony somewhat as it says "so I might have taken her to mee to wife," thus simply implying Pharaoh didn't actually marry Sarai.
