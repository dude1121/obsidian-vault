**Permittivity** is a [[Units of Measurement|measure]] of a material's ability to "permit" the establishment of an [[Electric Field|electric field]] (not to be confused with [[Permeability]]). It can be measured in [[Farads]] per [[metre]] $[\text{F}/\text{m}]$ but a more general unit is [[Coulomb|Coulombs]] squared per [[Newton]]-metres squared $[\text{C}^2/\text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2]$. Most of the time, we use *relative permittivity*, $\epsilon_r$, which is a way of expressing the permittivity of a material with reference to "free space" permittivity, that is, the permittivity of a [[Vacuum|vacuum]], $\epsilon_0$. 
$$
	\epsilon_0=8.854\times10^{-12}\text{ C}^2/\text{N}\text{m}^2
$$
Here is a table of commonly used permittivities: 

| **Dielectric**    | **$\epsilon_r$** | **Permittivity ($[\text{F}/\text{m}]$)**    |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Vacuum            | $1.0$            | $8.854\times10^{-12}$                       |
| Air               | $1.0006$         | $8.859\times10^{-12}$                       |
| Paper, parafinned | $2.5$            | $22.135\times10^{-12}$                      |
| Rubber            | $3.0$            | $26.562\times10^{-12}$                      |
| Oil               | $4.0$            | $35.416\times10^{-12}$                      |
| Mica              | $5.0$            | $44.270\times10^{-12}$                      |
| Glass             | $7.5$            | $66.405\times10^{-12}$                      |
| Ceramics          | $20-7500$        | $194.788\times10^{-12}-66.405\times10^{-9}$ |

The relative permittivity $\epsilon_{r}$ is the permittivity of a given material *relative to* the permittivity of free space. It is defined as,
$$
\epsilon_{r}=\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}}
$$
where $\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the material. Relative permittivity can also be found by,
$$
\epsilon_{r}=1+\chi_{e}
$$
where $\chi_{e}$ is the material's [[Electric Susceptibility|electric susceptibility]].
