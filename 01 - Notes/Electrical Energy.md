**Electrical energy** is a form of [[Energy|energy]] that relates to electrically [[Charge|charged]] particles and the movement of those particles. Typically those particles are [[Electron|electrons]] but not always. This energy is supplied in a circuit by a combination of the [[Current|current]] and [[Voltage|voltage]] that is delivered by that circuit.

Unlike most forms of energy, electrical energy is commonly measured in [[Kilowatt Hour|kilowatt hours]] $[\pu{ kWh}]$. Kilowatt hours are equivalent to [[Joule|joules]] with the relationship,
$$
1\ \pu{ kWh }=3.6\ \pu{ MJ}
$$
