A **unit vector** is a [[Vector|vector]] of [[Length|length]] (or _magnitude_) 1. It is typically denoted with a lower letter with a [[Circumflex|circumflex]], or 'hat'. Unit vectors may sometimes be called "normalized vectors."

The normalized vector $\hat{u}$ of a non-zero vector $\vec{u}$ in the direction of $\vec{u}$ is,
$$
\hat{u}=\frac{\vec{u}}{|u|}
$$
Unit vectors are often used to represent directions and typically form the basis of a [[Vector Space|vector space]], in which every vector may be written as a [[Linear Combination|linear combination]] form of unit vectors. For example, in physics we often use $\mathbf{\hat{i}}$, $\mathbf{\hat{j}}$, and $\mathbf{\hat{k}}$ as unit vectors to represent the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively.
