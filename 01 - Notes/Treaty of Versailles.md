The **Treaty of Versailles** was a peace treaty that concluded [[World War I]]. It was signed on June 28 1919 in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] at the Palace of Versailles, France. This date was exactly five years after the [[Assassination of Franz Ferdinand|assassination of Franz Ferdinand]]. It was the culmination of the [[Paris Peace Conference]] which lasted for about six months. It took effect on January 10 1920.

While this treaty is the most well known of WWI, it was not the only one. This treaty in particular declared peace between the [[Allied Powers]] and the [[Weimar Republic]], whereas the other members of the [[Central Powers]] signed separate peace treaties.[^1]

# History
The treaty was drafted in early 1919 at the Paris Peace Conference, primarily dictated by the "Big Four":
	- UK Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]
	- [[Third French Republic|French]] Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]]
	- President of the [[United States of America|United States]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]
	- Italian Prime Minister [[Vittorio Orlando]]
None of the defeated Central Powers were included in the conference, and even the associated allied powers like Canada only played a minor role in creating the treaty.
# Terms
## Territorial Losses
The treaty of Versailles reduced the German population by about $10\%$. The province of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was returned to France after the Germans had took it in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The [[Saarland]] was taken from Germany and placed under [[League of Nations]] supervision.[^2] The territory of Schleswig-Holstein were forced to hold a referendum where the northern part of the state opted to join Denmark.

In the east, most of German West Prussia was given to the newly independent [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and Germany was forced to renounce all claims in Poland. Portions of Upper Silesia were ceded to Poland as well and the province of Posen (which had been occupied by Poland during their fight for independence) was ceded to Poland too. [[Pomerelia]] was given to Poland to establish a "Polish corridor" which separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany and allowed Polish access to the Baltic sea.

The city of [[Gdańsk]] was declared independent and became the [[Free City of Danzig]].[^3]

Finally, all of Germany's colonies were taken and given to Britain, France, Japan and other Allied powers. These divisions of colonies were known as *mandates*.
## Reparations
Germany was blamed entirely for the outbreak of the war[^4] and made it responsible for paying war reparations to the allied powers. A commission that assessed the losses of the allied civilian population set an amount of $33 billion in 1921, despite this being an incredibly unreasonable sum that even economists at the time said would completely disrupt international finances. Nevertheless, the Allies insisted Germany must pay and the treaty allowed them to take punitive actions if Germany failed to pay on time.
## Demilitarization
The German army was restricted to only 100,000 men. Additionally, Germany was forced to remove their general staff and was not allowed to manufacture armoured cars, tanks, submarines, airplanes, or poison gas. A small number of factories was permitted to make weapons or munitions, but that was it. The [[Rhineland]], part of German west of the Rhine river, was made a demilitarized zone.[^5][^6]
## Changes after 1920
In the years following the ratification of the treaty, Germany had requested the treaty be revised due to the economic impact it had on the Germans. Numerous concessions were made in German favour such that, by 1938, the only clauses still in effect were the territorial changes.

[^1]: Specifically, [[German-Austria]] signed the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] on Sept. 10 1919, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] signed the [[Treaty of Trianon]] on June 4 1920, [[Tsardom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] signed the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]] on Nov. 27 1919, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] signed the [[Treaty of Sévres]] on August 10 1920 (although this treaty was never officially ratified)

[^2]: The Saarland would hold a referendum in 1935 that saw it reunite with Germany, now under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]].

[^3]: Similarly to the Saarland, Danzig would remain independent until the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] came to power, but this time it would fall due to the German invasion in 1939.

[^4]: This is also known as the [[War Guilt Clause]] and it is of particular importance for how Germans responded to the treaty.

[^5]: While these clauses served to incite anger in the German people and allowed a fascist leader like Hitler to rise to power, its goal was apparently to lead to *less* militarization in Europe. The thought was that if Germany had a smaller military, surrounding nations that were scared of Germany wouldn't need a large army to defend themselves.

[^6]: The Rhineland was re-militarized in 1936 with no Allied response, prompting further German militarization.
