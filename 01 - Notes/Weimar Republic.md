The **Weimar Republic**, officially called the **German Reich**, was the German state after [[World War I|WWI]] and before [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] came to power in 1933. The name *Weimar Republic* comes from the city of Weimar where the constituent assembly was held that established the post-Kaiser government and was popularized by Adolf Hitler in 1929.
# Creation
In November 1918, Germany is declared a Republic after the Kaiser William II is forced to abdicate on November 9. The chancellor, Maximilian, Prince of Baden, also resigned and appointed the leader of the Social Democratic Party [[Friedrich Ebert]] as the new leader of Germany. On February 11, 1919, Ebert was officially made President of the new German Republic, and another Social Democrat, Philipp Scheidemann, was named Chancellor.

On February 6, 1919, the national assembly meets in Weimar to draft the new German constitution. Constitution was finalized by August 11, 1919. The constitution strengthened the powers of the government and all power was given to the Reichstag (the Weimar parliament). Suffrage was granted to all men and women over 20 years old.

The constitution also introduced the president as a counterweight to the Reichstag. The president was elected independently of the Reichstag, elected by the nation directly. The president was responsible for foreign affairs and was supreme commander of the armed forces. They also had the authority to dissolve the Reichstag and suspend civil liberties guaranteed by the constitution in the event of emergency.

The constitution also declared protection of trade unions, an 8-hour workday, and the right to collectively bargain. 
# Treaty of Versailles
The [[Treaty of Versailles]] harshly punished Germany for [[World War I]]. Germany was forced to cede a lot of land to France and Poland. Germany was also not allowed to negotiate the treaty which left a very bitter taste in the mouths of the German people. Germany was further forced to pay an absurd amount of money for reparations and their military is restricted to 100,000 men. 

The terms of the treaty were abhorrent to the German people and all German political parties were united in opposition to it. Many believed that, since the treaty was a departure from [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], Germany had been tricked into signing the treaty. However, at the threat of invasion, Germany's assembly gave approval to sign the treaty on June 23, 1919, and 5 days later it was signed.
