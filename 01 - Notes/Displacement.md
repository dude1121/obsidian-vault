**Displacement** is the change in an object's [[Position|position]]. Displacement is a [[Vector|vector]] quantity and it is typically denoted with $\vec{d}$. Displacement is not interchangeable with [[Distance|distance]], which is the scalar counterpart to displacement.
$$
\vec{d}=\vec{r_{f}}-\vec{r_{i}}
$$
If the displacement varies with [[Time|time]], then we call that variation its [[Velocity|velocity]].
