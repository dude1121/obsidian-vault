In an [[AC Electricity|ac]] electrical circuit, **reactive power**, often designated as $Q$, is power that is stored and released within the circuit, but not consumed. It is contrasted with [[Real Power|real power]], which is consumed by the circuit. Reactive power is the [[Complex Numbers|imaginary]] component of [[Apparent Power|apparent power]]. While technically reactive power has the same units as real and apparent power, it is typically denoted as having units of $[\pu{ VAR}]$, meaning "volt-amps reactive", often just read as "vars". 

Reactive power sometimes has an "inductive" or "capacitive" designation to show that the circuit is primarily inductive or capacitive. Convention here is to use an $_{L}$ to denote inductive and $_{C}$ to denote capacitive. I.e., $[\pu{ VAR_{\ L} }]$ and $[\pu{ VAR_{\ C} }]$.  Reactive power is typically defined in terms of real and apparent power, that is,
$$
Q=\sqrt{ S^2-P^2 }
$$
but it can also be defined in terms of [[Voltage|voltage]] and [[Current|current]],
$$
Q=VI\sin \theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the phase angle between the voltage and the current.
