# Thoughts
Much like chapter 1, there is not a lot here that directly contradicts what I've been brought up to believe. However, I find it interesting how JWs try to sell the 2 creation stories as one uniform story since they clearly contradict each other.

The NWT says in Genesis 2.19, "Now [[Jehovah]] God _had been_ forming from the ground every wild animal..." This small but significant change seems like a way to alter the text to make the order of events in [[Genesis 1]] line up with the order in Genesis 2, even though no other translation seems to say this.

According to *gm ch.7 pp.94-95 ¶17,18*, JWs give the reason for the discrepancy as simply two different accounts: one giving the events chronologically, and the other gives the events of man's creation, and introduces events as they become important.

Okay, but if Genesis is indeed written by one man ([[Moses]]), why did he feel the need to repeat this account? Why not include the information about Eden around Genesis 1.11-13, when God creates vegetation? Why not include Adam naming animals in Genesis 1.24,25? And why would the second account mention God creating man first when clearly the first account shows a different order?

This argument, like many I've seen lately, seems flawed.
