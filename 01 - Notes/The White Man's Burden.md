# The text
> Take up the White Man's burden-
> 	Send forth the best ye breed-
> Go bind your sons to exile
> 	To serve your captives' need;
> To wait in heavy harness
> 	On fluttered folk and wild-
> Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
> 	Half devil and half child
> 	
> Take up the White Man's burden-
> 	In patience to abide,
> To veil the threat of terror
> 	And check the show of pride;
> By open speech and simple,
> 	An hundred times made plain.
> To seek another's profit,
> 	And work another's gain.
> 
> Take up the White Man's burden-
> 	The savage wars of peace-
> Fill full the mouth of Famine
> 	And bid the sickness cease;
> And when your goal is nearest
> 	The end for others sought,
> Watch Sloth and heathen Folly
> 	Bring all your hopes to nought.
> 	
> Take up the White Man's burden-
> 	No tawdry rule of kings,
> But toil of serf and sweeper-
> 	The tale of common things.
> The ports ye shall not enter,
> 	The roads ye shall not tread,
> Go make them with your living,
> 	And mark them with your dead!
> 	
> Take up the White Man's burden-
> 	And reap his old reward:
> The blame of those ye better,
> 	The hate of those ye guard-
> The cry of hosts ye humour
> 	(Ah, slowly!) toward the light-
> "Why brought ye us from bondage,
> 	Our loved Egyptian night?"
> 
> Take up the White Man's burden-
> 	Ye dare not stoop to less
> Nor call too loud on Freedom
> 	To cloak your weariness;
> By all ye cry or whisper,
> 	By all ye leave or do,
> The silent, sullen peoples
> 	Shall weigh your Gods and you.
> 
> Take up the White Man's burden-
> 	Have done with childish days-
> The lightly proffered laurel,
> 	The easy, ungrudged praise.
> Comes now, to search your manhood
> 	Through all the thankless years,
> Cold-edged with dear-bought wisom,
> 	The judgement of your peers!
# The Brown Man's Burden
> Pile on the brown man's burden
> 	To gratify your greed;
> Go, clear away the "niggers"
> 	Who progress would impede;
> Be very stern, for truly
> 	'Tis useless to be mild
> With new-caught, sullen peoples,
> 	Half devil and half child
> 
> Pile on the brown man's burden;
> 	And, if ye rouse his hate,
> Meet his old-fashioned reasons
> 	With Maxims up to date.
> With shells and dumdum bullets
> 	A hundred times made plain
> The brown man's loss must ever
> 	Imply the white man's gain.
> 
> Pile on the brown man's burden,
> 	compel him to be free;
> Let all your manifestoes
> 	Reek with philanthropy.
> And if with heathen folly
> 	He dares your will dispute,
> Then, in the name of freedom,
> 	Don't hesitate to shoot.
> 
> Pile on the brown man's burden,
> 	And if his cry be sore,
> That surely need not irk you-
> 	Ye've driven slaves before.
> Seize on his ports and pastures,
> 	The fields his people tread;
> Go make from them your living,
> 	And mark them with his dead.
> 	
> Pile on the brown man's burden,
> 	And through the world proclaim
> That ye are Freedom's agent-
> 	There's no more paying game!
> And, should your own past history
> 	Straight in your teeth be thrown,
> Retort that independence
> 	Is good for whites alone.
>

# The Black Man's Burden
> Pile on the Black Man's Burden.
> 	'Tis nearest at your door;
> Why heed long bleeding Cuba,
> 	or dark Hawaii's shore?
> Hail ye your fearless armies,
> 	Which menace feeble folks
> Who fight with clubs and arrows
> 	and brook your rifle's smoke.
> 
> Pile on the Black Man's Burden
> 	His wail with laughter drown
> You've sealed the Red Man's problem,
> 	And will take up the brown,
> In vain ye seek to end it,
> 	With bullets, blood or death
> Better by far defend it
> 	With honor's holy breath.
> 	
> - H.T. Johnson, "The Black Man's Burden", April 1899

## Discussion Post Assignment
#### 1. What truths do Labouchère and Johnson point out (and contradict) about Kipling's "The White Man's Burden" in the "Brown Man's Burden" and "The Black Man's Burden"? Explain.
Labouchère and Johnson both begin their stanzas with "Pile on the \[non-white] man's burden..." which reframes the narrative of the poem. No longer is it a call to action for white men to bring 'civilization' to, in their view, 'savage' people. Instead, Labouchère and Johnson correctly indicate who actually is "taking up" this burden: the people being colonized. Labouchère in his poem directly refutes one of Kipling's verses. Kipling wrote: 

"The ports ye shall not enter / The roads ye shall not tread, / Go make them with your living, / And mark them with your dead!" 

In response, Labouchère says, 

"Seize on his ports and pastures / The fields his people tread; / Go make from them your living / And mark them with his dead."

Kipling clearly implies here that the white man can not enter the ports or walk the roads of the savages because there are none. The white man needs to extol his own labour to build these things. Labouchère counters that these pastures and ports were present, but white men had destroyed or stolen them when they arrived. Note the difference in the final couplet too. "Make them \[the roads, ports, etc.] with your living" versus "Make *from* them your living" and "mark them with your dead" versus "mark them with *his* dead." The white man wasn't the one who died building the roads, that was the natives. Colonization often came with rape and abuse of women in general, so the line "make from them your living" implies that the colonizers would use the native men for slave labour, the women for sex and children, and these natives would be cast aside (or shot, as the poem goes on to mention) the second they were no longer needed.
#### 2. What does this tell us about race relations historically (prior to the first world war)?
Kipling's poem reflects the predominant view of the peoples that were colonized. "Half devil and half child", the people are full of "Sloth and heathen folly" that will thwart the white man's attempt at 'civilization'. The responses to Kipling's poem tell us that by this point in history (the turn of the 20th century) white people had began encountering some resistance to their rampant colonization, and not just from colonized peoples. Henry Labouchère was a white British MP who was vocal against the United Kingdom's expansions in Africa, particularly the Second Boer War. This opposition to racist imperialism was growing on the homefront, and civil rights movements were gaining traction. H.T. Johnson was an African-American pastor who established the Mutual United Brotherhood of Liberty (MUBL) which was a social justice and civil rights group in Baltimore, Maryland. As the world moved into the 20th century, these groups would only get larger and louder as hostilities between colonizers and those colonized became worse.
#### 3. How can we apply it to the state of race relations today? (Think 'Black Lives Matter') Think about how things have changed and how they haven't.
Today the "White Man's Burden" voices have become quieter, but they definitely have not gone away. In years since World War II, civil rights for minorities have improved but are nowhere close to perfect. While non-white voices have been amplified, the power dynamics are still very imbalanced. According to Statista.com, from 2017 - 2024 about 58% of police shootings in the United States were non-white and, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (USA) non-whites make up 43.1% of the prison population, despite non-white people making up only 25% of the entire US population. There is a clear disparity between the number of non-white people in the United States versus those targeted by authorities. This is admittedly samples only from one country, but it is indicative of the west in general. Recently, we've even seen an increase in white nationalism in the United States. Plus ça change...
