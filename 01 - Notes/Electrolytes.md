An **electrolyte** is a substance that conducts electricity through the movement of [[Ion|ions]], not the movement of [[Electron|electrons]]. Most soluble [[Ionic Compound|salts]], [[Acid|acids]], and [[Base|bases]], when dissolved in a polar solvent (typically water) are electrolytes. Electrolytes can be classified as *strong* or *weak*.

# Strong Electrolytes

Strong electrolytes are substances that are entirely ionized when they are dissolved. This category includes salts, strong acids, and strong bases. Take [[Sodium Chloride|sodium chloride]] as an example. When it dissolves in water, it produces $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{Cl-}$ ions in the solution. This makes $\ce{NaCl}$ a strong electrolyte, since it splits entirely into ions when dissolved.

Strong acids like [[Hydrochloric Acid|hydrochloric acid]] $\ce{HCl}$, [[Nitric Acid|nitric acid]] $\ce{HNO_{3}}$, and [[Sulfuric Acid|sulfuric acid]] $\ce{H_{2}SO_{4}}$ are also strong electrolytes. When dissolved in water, they all produce a [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] cation and the accompanying [[Polyatomic Ion|polyatomic ions]].  For example,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ce{HCl}&\ce{->[H_{2}O]H+(aq) + CL-(aq)}\\
\ce{HNO_{3}}&\ce{->[H_{2}O]H+(aq) + NO_{3}-(aq)}\\
\ce{H_{2}SO_{4}}&\ce{->[H_{2}O] H+(aq) + HSO_{4}-(aq)}
\end{aligned}
$$
Strong bases such as [[Sodium Hydroxide|sodium hydroxide]] $\ce{NaOH}$ or [[Potassium Hydroxide|potassium hydroxide]] $\ce{KOH}$ are other examples of strong electrolytes. Much like how strong acids separate into $\ce{H+}$ and the acid ion, strong bases separate into a [[Hydroxide|hydroxide]] ion and the base ion.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ce{NaOH(s)}&\ce{->[H_{2}O]Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)}\\
\ce{KOH(s)}&\ce{->[H_{2}O]K+(aq) + OH-(aq)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
# Weak Electrolytes

Weak electrolytes are substances that produce relatively few ions when dissolved. Most commonly these substances are weak acids or bases. For example, the principle acidic component of vinegar is [[Acetic Acid|acetic acid]] $\ce{HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}}$. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ce{HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}(aq) + H_{2}O(l)<=>H_{3}O+(aq) + C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}-(aq)}
\end{aligned}
$$
Compared to a strong acid, acetic acid is very weak, with only 1 in 100 molecules of acetic acid dissolving in water. This inability to fully dissolve in water is what makes it a weak acid. A comparatively weak base is [[Ammonia|ammonia]] $\ce{NH_{3}}$. When dissolved in water, ammonia becomes
$$
\ce{NH_{3}(aq) + H_{2}O(l) <=> NH_{4}+(aq) + OH-(aq)}
$$
This solution is basic because $\ce{OH-}$ ions are produced. Similar to acetic acid, only 1 in 100 molecules of ammonia will actually react. 

# Nonelectrolytes

Nonelectrolytes are water-soluble substances that do not produce any ions. Examples include [[Ethanol|ethanol]] $\ce{C_{2}H_{5}OH}$ or [[Sucrose|sucrose]] $\ce{C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}}$.
