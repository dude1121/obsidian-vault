The **natural numbers** are an infinite set of numbers ranging from $1$ to [[Infinity|infinity]]. Sometimes the natural numbers include $0$, it depends on the author. Other times, the set of all positive [[Integer|integers]] including $0$ is called the *whole numbers* $\mathbb{W}$. 

Since the natural numbers contain only positive integers, they are sometimes called the *counting numbers*. This also means that the natural numbers are technically the oldest form of number system.
