A **retarding force** is a [[Force|force]] that acts in the opposite direction of [[Motion|motion]]. It is typically denoted by $\mathbf{\vec{R}}$ and since it is a force it is measured in [[Newton|newtons]] $[\pu{ N}]$. We can express the retarding force by
$$
\mathbf{\vec{R}}=-b\mathbf{\vec{v}}
$$
where $b$ is the [[Damping Coefficient|damping coefficient]] and $\mathbf{\vec{v}}$ is the velocity of the object. Therefore the retarding force is directly proportional to the velocity of the object in motion. This is the principle responsible for [[Terminal Velocity|terminal velocity]].
