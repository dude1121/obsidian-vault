In physics, a **force** is an external influence that causes an object to change its [[Acceleration|acceleration]]. There are two distinct types of forces: *contact* forces and *[[Field Force|field forces]]*. Contact forces are very straightforward: they occur when one object makes physical contact with another object. Field forces do not involve physical contact and include forces like [[Gravity|gravity]], [[Electric Field|electric field forces]], and [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field forces]]. Of course, at the atomic level, all forces are a result of field forces, however it can be useful to split the two up for analysis purposes. 

Force is a [[Vector|vector]] quantity and it is measured in [[Newton|newtons]], named after the man who literally wrote the book on forces, [[Isaac Newton]]. According to Newton's [[Newton's Laws|second law]],
$$
\sum \mathbf{\vec{F}}=m\mathbf{\vec{a}}
$$
A special case arises when discussing the force acting on an object due to [[Gravitational Force|gravity]]. This is given by,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{g}=m\mathbf{\vec{g}}
$$
where $\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{g}$ is the force acting on the object and $\mathbf{\vec{g}}$ is the acceleration of the object due to gravity ($\approx 9.801\pu{ m/s^2}$). If the object is not in free-fall and is resting or in motion on some surface, perpendicular to that surface there will be a [[Normal Force|normal force]], which will be equal to the relevant component of the gravitational force, but in the opposite direction. This is a direct application of Newton's third law.

# Fundamental Forces

There are four fundamental forces in nature:
- Gravitational forces
- Electromagnetic forces
- Strong forces
- Weak forces
