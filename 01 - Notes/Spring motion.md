**Spring motion** is a model for [[Simple harmonic motion|simple harmonic motion]] and is an example of a simple harmonic oscillator. Consider a block of mass $m$ attached to the end of a [[Spring|spring]] with the block free to move on a horizontal, frictionless surface. When the spring is neither stretched nor compressed, the block rests at the *equilibrium position* of the system, we'll identify it as $x=0$. When the block is disturbed, it will oscillate back and forth from this equilibrium point.

The oscillating motion of the spring can be described by [[Hooke's Law|Hooke's law]],
$$
F_{s}=-kx
$$
The force $F_{s}$ is called a *restoring force* because it is always directed toward the equilibrium position and therefore opposite the displacement of the block from equilibrium. We can apply [[Newton's Laws#Second Law|Newton's second law]] to the above equation,
$$
\begin{align}
ma_{x}&=-kx \\
a_{x}&=-\frac{kx}{m}
\end{align}
$$
That is, the [[Acceleration|acceleration]] of the block is proportional to its [[Position|position]] and its direction is acceleration is opposite to the direction of the block's [[Displacement|displacement]]. Systems that behave this way exhibit simple harmonic motion.
