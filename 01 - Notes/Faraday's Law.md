**Faraday's Law** states that an induced [[Electromotive Force|emf]] in a conductor is proportional to the negative of the change in [[Magnetic Flux|magnetic flux]]. 
$$
\mathcal{E}=\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
$$
If the coil generating the changing [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]] contains $N$ loops or *turns*, this increases the induced emf.
$$
\mathcal{E}=N\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
$$
This is known as *Faraday's Law of Induction*. It is related to [[Lenz's Law]].
