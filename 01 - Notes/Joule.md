A **joule** is a unit of measurement for [[Energy|energy]]. It is named after English physicist [[James Prescott Joule]]. In SI base units, a joule is defined as,
$$
1\pu{\! J}=1\ \pu{ kg\cdot m^2\cdot s^{-2} }
$$
One joule is equal to the amount of [[Work|work]] done when a [[Force|force]] of $1\ \pu{ N}$ displaces a body through a distance of $1\ \pu{ m}$.
