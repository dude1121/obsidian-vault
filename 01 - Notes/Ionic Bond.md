An **ionic bond** is a type of [[Chemical Bond|chemical bond]] between two [[Atom|atoms]] that results in an [[Ionic Compound|ionic compound]]. This type of bond occurs when one atom loses an [[Electron|electron]] (becoming positively [[Charge|charged]]) and gives that electron to another neutral atom (making it negatively charged). Since the two atoms now have opposite charges, they attract one another, forming a bond between the two. 

Metals have a relatively low [[Ionization Energy|ionization energy]], meaning when a metal is near a non-metal and it is given some [[Energy|energy]], it will become a cation and one of its [[Valence Shell|valence]] electrons will become free.
$$
\ce{Na->Na+ + e-}
$$
This free electron might then collide with the non-metal, adding to its valence shell. This makes the non-metal negatively charged.
$$
\ce{Cl + e- ->Cl-}
$$
These two ions can now combine to form an ionic compound. In this case, [[Sodium Chloride|sodium chloride]].
$$
\ce{Na+ + Cl- -> NaCl}
$$
[[Chlorine]] often occurs as a gas molecule, making this equation not properly balanced, so some coefficients must be added to make the equation true.
$$
\ce{2Na+ + Cl_{2}- -> 2NaCl}
$$
