**Nuclear fission** is a process that occurs when a heavy [[Nucleus|nucleus]] is split up into two smaller nuclei. Fission can occur naturally but typically when we talk about nuclear fission we are talking about fission that we initiate. We can initiate nuclear fission by firing a [[Thermal Neutron|thermal neutron]] at a nucleus. The absorption of this [[Neutron|neutron]] causes the nucleus to become unstable and forces it to drop to a lower energy state by splitting into two smaller nuclei. In this type of reaction, the combined mass of the products is less than the mass of the parent nucleus, and the difference in mass is called the [[Mass Defect|mass defect]]. We can calculate the energy released in a fission reaction by multiplying the mass defect by $c^2$. 
$$
E_{\text{released}}=m_{\text{defect}}c^2
$$
This is [[Mass-Energy Equivalence|Einstein's mass-energy equivalency]] equation.

For [[Fission Reactor|nuclear reactors]] or [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear weapons]], [[Uranium|uranium]] is typically used as the fissile material. Specifically, $\ce{^{235}U}$ is used, since the more stable isotope (and more common) of $\ce{^{238}U}$ is not fissile. The fission of $\ce{^{235}U}$ by thermal neutrons can be represented by the reaction:
$$
\ce{^1_{0}n +^{235}_{92}U -> ^{236}_{92}U -> X + Y + neutrons}
$$
where the $\ce{^{236}_{92}U}$ is an intermediate state that lasts for only approximately $10^{-12}\pu{ s}$ before splitting into $\ce{X}$ and $\ce{Y}$ which are called *fission fragments*. In any fission reaction there are many combinations of $\ce{X}$ and $\ce{Y}$ that can be formed that satisfy the [[Law of Conservation of Energy|conservation of energy]] and [[Law of Conservataion of Charge|charge]]. For uranium, approximately $90$ daughter nuclei can be formed. This reaction also produced some neutrons. On average, $2.5$ neutrons are produced per fission event. For example,
$$
\ce{^1_{0}n + ^{235}_{92}U -> ^{141}_{56}Ba + ^{92}_{36}Kr + 3(^1_{0}n)}
$$
The amount of neutrons produced is determined by which products end up forming. In the above case, [[Barium|barium]] and [[Krypton|krypton]] (whose masses combined is $A=233\pu{ u}$) end up having $3$ neutrons left over after they reach their stable isotopes. A plot of the probability of a given combination of products is shown below.

As the plot shows, the highest probability shows two products with a mass of around $A\approx 95$ and $A \approx 140$. 
# Disintegration energy
The amount of energy released in a typical fission process is called the *disintegration energy* $Q$. The disintegration energy is the difference between the binding energies of the daughter products and the parent nucleus. For example, $E_{\text{b(U)}}\approx 7.2\pu{ MeV}$, and $E_{\text{b(products)}}\approx 8.2\pu{ MeV}$. This means that for an average fission reaction, $Q=8.2\pu{ MeV}-7.2\pu{ MeV}=1\pu{ MeV}$ per nucleon. That means that for an entire $\ce{^{235}_{92}U}$ nucleus, the total disintegration energy released is approximately $235\pu{\! MeV}$.
