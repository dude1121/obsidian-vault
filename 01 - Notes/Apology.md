- [[Socrates]]' defense in his trial. Split into three parts: Socrates' opening argument, his counter-assessment after hearing the guilty verdict, and his closing remarks after having been sentenced to death. ([[Five Dialogues]], p. 21)
# Opening Argument / Main Defense
 Socrates splits his main defense into two parts: the old charges, and the recent charges.
## Old Charges
- The origin of these charges, Socrates claims, is due to his friend, [[Chaerephon]], visiting the [[Delphi Oracle]] and asking if there is any man [[Wisdom|wiser]] than Socrates. The Pythian responded "no". (p. 25-26)
- Socrates is confused, as he believes he knows nothing at all, so he begins to visit all the so-called "wise" men to try to prove the Oracle wrong, to find someone wiser than himself. Yet in every man he met with and approached, he found that they had the *appearance* of wisdom, but none of the substance. Because he kept pointing out to these men that they were not wise, he became very unpopular.
>[!quote] Apology, p. 26
> So I withdrew and thought to myself: "I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not, whereas when I do not know, neither do I think I know; so I am likely to be wiser than he to this small extent, **that I do not think I know what I do not know**."
- After meeting all the wise men in Athens, he concludes,
>[!quote] Apology, p. 26
>In my investigation in the service of the god I found that those who had the highest reputation were nearly the most deficient, while those who were thought to be inferior were more knowledgeable.
- Reputation is misleading, according to Socrates. These men who had boasted about their wisdom actually lacked any.
- After speaking to these men, he turns to both poets and craftsmen, and finds similar problems. Because they are gifted and wise in one thing (poetry or craftsmanship), they think that they are simultaneously wise in everything else.
- His ultimate conclusion is that the oracle was correct, but the meaning was misinterpreted. 
>[!quote] Apology p. 27
>What is probable, gentlemen, is that in fact the god is wise and that his oracular response meant that *human wisdom* is worth little or nothing, and that when he says this man, Socrates, he is using my name as an example, as if he said: 'This man among you, mortals, is wisest who, like Socrates, understands that his wisdom is worthless.'
- Human wisdom is then to blame. Ironically this is probably the wisest thing he says, that the wisest course is to reject human wisdom, at least human wisdom of men who self-profess to be wise. Wisdom is found in [[humility]], not [[pride]].
- Socrates notes that this course has not brought him wealth, like it has his "wise" contemporaries who charge up to 5 minas for their knowledge (p. 25), but rather he is in poverty because of this "service to the god". (p. 28)
- He concludes by saying that those who have accused him of "corrupting" the Athenian youth are unable to come up with any specific examples, so instead resort to generic charges of teaching about "things in the sky and things below the earth" and "not believing in [[Greek Pantheon|the gods]]" and "making the worse the stronger argument".
## Recent Charges
- Socrates now addresses [[Meletus]] directly. He first attacks Meletus' claim that Socrates has corrupted the youth of Athens. He counters by saying that Meletus does not really care about the youth he so readily defends. He begs Meletus to tell him who it is that is improving the youth. (p. 28-29)
- Meletus says that everyone, the jurymen, the audience, the councillors, every single Athenian, less Socrates, improves the youth. Socrates argues this is insane to suggest that only one singular person is corrupting the youth. It isn't the case that everyone improves the lives of, say, horses, and only one person corrupts them. Rather, it would be the other way around. Those unfamiliar with horse training, the vast majority, would do harm to horses, but only those trained in horses would do them well. (p. 29-30)
- Socrates then reasons that it would make no sense for him to have corrupted the youth, since no man ever does something deliberately that harms himself, and a corrupted or "wicked" person would harm their neighbour, in this case, Socrates.
	- cf. [[Ephesians]] 5.29
- Socrates moves on now to Meletus' charge that Socrates is an [[Atheism|atheist]]. He gets Meletus to reiterate his claim that Socrates does in fact not just reject the Athenian gods but that he does not believe in any gods whatsoever. He asks Meletus if someone would believe in human acts, but not in humans. Or in horseman's activities but not in horses. Meletus responds that no one would do that. Socrates pushes and says that he can't possibly be an atheist, by Meletus' own admission, since Meletus accuses Socrates of believing in and teaching "new spiritual things". Socrates couldn't believe in spiritual things but not believe in spirits or gods. (p. 31-32)
- Socrates does not offer any further defence, rather saying that he is not worried about his potential death at the hands of the jury, because life and [[Death|death]] are not what is ultimately important.
>[!quote] Apology p. 32-33
>You are wrong, sir, if you think that a man who is any good at all should take into account the risk of life or death; he should look to this only in his actions, whether what he does is right or wrong, whether he is acting like a good or a bad man.
- Socrates says it is better to fulfill your duty, potentially at your own peril, than to run away from death.
>[!quote] Apology p. 33
>To fear death, gentlemen, is no other than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know. No one knows whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for a man, yet men fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of all evils.
- To Socrates, [[Fear of Death|fearing death]] is no better than the men he challenged publicly who claimed they knew things that they did not. It is unwise to fear death because no man has knowledge of what death is. It is illogical to fear it.
- Socrates then says that even if the jury were to acquit him on the condition that he never practice philosophy again, he would reject those terms, even if it meant his certain death.
	- His rebuttal feels reminiscent of [[Acts]] 5.29. 
>[!quote] Apology p. 34
>...if you said to me in this regard: "Socrates, we do not believe Anytus now, we acquit you, but only on condition that you spend no more time on this investigation and do not practice philosophy, and if you are caught doing so you will die"; if, as I say, you were to acquit me on those terms, I would say to you: "Men of Athens, I am grateful and I am your friend, but I will obey the god rather than you, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy... For I go around doing nothing but persuading both young and old among you not to care for your body or your wealth in preference to or as strongly as for the best possible state of your soul, as I say to you: Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively."
- Socrates says that he is not making a defense on his own behalf, but rather he is making a defense on the behalf of the jury, to prevent them from "mistreating the god's gift to you by condemning me". 
	- He goes on to say that there will be no person like him in the future, and if they kill him now they will come to regret it
# Guilty verdict
- Socrates is found guilty by the jury and Meletus requests the death penalty for Socrates. Socrates argues that, while he does not *want* to die, if death is the penalty for doing the things Meletus says he did, then he should be put to death.
- However, he then moves on to exile being a fitting punishment, since he can not pay a fine since he is poor and feels he should not be imprisoned, permanently subjected to the men who found him guilty.
- In exile, Socrates reasons that he would just do that same thing elsewhere as he did in Athens but for good reason.
>[!quote] Apology p.41
>Perhaps someone might say: But Socrates, if you leave us will you not be able to live quietly, without talking? Now this is the most difficult point on which to convince some of you. If I say that it is impossible for me to keep quiet because that means disobeying the god, you will not believe me and will think I am being ironical. On the other hand, if I say that it is the greatest good for a man to discuss virtue every day and those other things about which you hear me conversing and testing myself and others, *for the unexamined life is not worth living* for men, you will believe me even less.
- I love this quote, "for the unexamined life is not worth living". To Socrates, a life where he is not allowed to reason and think and converse with the populace is not a life at all, and he might as well be given the death penalty.
- Socrates' defence against the death penalty is really about [[Truth|truth]]. Is it better to hear and accept truth even though it may be harmful or infuriating? Or is it better to drive that truth and the one proclaiming it away? Socrates tells the men of Athens what he believes is true and will better them. He does this to help them live an *examined* life, since this is what Socrates believes is the meaning of living.
# Sentenced to death
- Socrates is now reconciling with death. He argues that no man should contrive to avoid death at any cost, instead, they should accept it when it comes. To avoid death is cowardice; anyone can avoid death but few if any can avoid wickedness.
> [!quote] Apology p.42
> Neither I nor any other man should, on trial or in war, contrive to avoid death at any cost. Indeed it is often obvious in battle that one could escape death by throwing away one's weapons and by turning to supplicate one's pursuers, and there are many ways to avoid death in every kind of danger if one will venture to do or say anything to avoid it. It is not difficult to avoid death, gentlemen; it is much more difficult to avoid wickedness, for it runs faster than death.
- In this section Socrates is also wrestling with the concept of [[Death|death]]. He says that death is either a) a dreamless, eternal sleep, or b) the promised [[Greek Underworld|Greek afterlife]].
>[!quote] Apology p.43
>Let us reflect in this way, too, that there is good hope that death is a blessing, for it is one of two things: either the dead are nothing and have no perception of anything, or it is, as we are told, a change and a relocating for the [[Soul|soul]] from here to another place.
- If death is an eternal sleep, Socrates continues, then he will be satisfied, since if a someone had a dreamless sleep they would rank that sleep as one of the best in their life. 
- If instead he is to go down to Hades, then even better, as Socrates can think of nothing better than spending eternity with the likes of [[Homer]], [[Orpheus]], and [[Hesiod]]. 
- He concludes his statement by saying that he is off to go die and they are off to go live, and it is up to the god whose lot is better.
