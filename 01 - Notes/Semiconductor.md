A **semiconductor** is a material that has conductivities between those of [[Metal|metals]] and [[Insulator|insulators]]. There are two general classifications of semiconductors: *elemental semiconductors*, found in the [[Carbon Group|carbon group]] ([[Silicon|silicon]] and [[Germanium|germanium]]); and *compound semiconductor materials* formed from special combinations of [[Boron Group|boron group]] elements and [[Pnictogens|pnictogens]] (not including [[Nitrogen|nitrogen]]). Some example of compound semiconductors are [[Aluminum Phosphide|aluminum phosphide]] $\ce{AlP}$, [[Aluminum Arsenide|aluminum arsenide]] $\ce{AlAs}$, [[Gallium Phosphide|gallium phosphide]] $\ce{GaP}$, [[Gallium Arsenide|gallium arsenide]] $\ce{GaAs}$, and [[Indium Phosphide|indium phosphide]] $\ce{InP}$. Semiconducting materials can also be formed between [[Group 12|group 12]] and [[Chalcogens|chalcogens]] but these are much less common.

Of the semiconductors mentioned above, silicon is one of the most prevalent. Gallium arsenide has some interesting optical properties that make it very useful as well.
