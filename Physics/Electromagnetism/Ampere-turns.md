The **Ampere-turn** is a measure of [[Magnetomotive Force|magnetomotive force]] in a [[Magnetic Circuit|magnetic circuit]]. It is defined as,
$$
1\text{ At}=1\text{ A}\cdot \text{t}
$$
Although, since the $t$ is not really a defined [[Units of Measurement|unit]], the ampere-turn is no different from an [[Amperes|ampere]]. To avoid confusion, however, we use ampere-turn to distinguish that we are talking about a magnetic circuit and not an electrical one.
