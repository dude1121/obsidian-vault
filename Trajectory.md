A **trajectory** (also known as a *flight path*) is the path that an object in motion follows as a function of [[Time|time]]. In classical mechanics, a trajectory is defined by [[Hamiltonian Mechanics|Hamiltonian mechanics]] where a complete trajectory is defined by [[Position|position]] and [[Linear Momentum|momentum]], simultaneously.
