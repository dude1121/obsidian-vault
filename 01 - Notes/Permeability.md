**Permeability** is a measure of a material's ability to permit the establishment of a magnetic field through itself. Not to be confused with [[Permittivity]]. It is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Webers]] per [[Amperes|ampere]]-[[Metre|metres]] $\left[ \frac{\text{Wb}}{\text{A}\cdot \text{m}} \right]$. This quality is what determines whether we perceive a material to be *magnetic* or not. Objects with low permeability are magnetic, whereas materials with high permeability are not. The permeability of air is
$$
\mu_{0}=4\pi \times 10^{-7}\text{ Wb}/\text{A}\cdot \text{m}
$$
Unlike with permittivity where there is a table of various materials' permittivities, no such table exists for permeability because a material's relative permeability ($\mu_r$) is a function of the operating conditions. If the [[Magnetomotive Force|magnetomotive force]] (mmf) is changed, $\mu$ may vary between extreme limits.
