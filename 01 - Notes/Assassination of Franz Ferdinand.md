The **assassination of Franz Ferdinand**, the archduke of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]], occurred on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Bosnia, a newly acquired province of the empire that was [[Bosnian Crisis|annexed]] by Austria in 1908.
# Setup
[[Franz Ferdinand]] was the cousin of the current Austro-Hungarian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I]]. He and his wife, Sophie, were on a tour in Bosnia as part of Ferdinand's duties as Inspector-General of the Armed Forces. He was to inspect the military present in Sarajevo as well as engage in a political tour of the city with his wife.

A Serbian terrorist organization known as [[The Black Hand]] had trained operatives stationed in Bosnia with orders to kill the Archduke.

As Ferdinand and his wife rode through the streets of Sarajevo, a member of the black hand, 19-year-old Nedeljko Čabrinović tossed a bomb at the convoy. He missed the archduke and hit the car behind him.
