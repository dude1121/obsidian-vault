In an [[AC Electricity|ac]] electrical circuit, **apparent power** is the total [[Power|power]] present in the circuit. It is the [[Vector#Vector Addition|vector sum]] of the [[Real Power|real power]] and [[Reactive Power|reactive power]].  Since the direction of the apparent power is typically not important, we can express the apparent power simply as,
$$
S=\sqrt{ P^2+Q^2 }
$$
where $S$ is the apparent power in $[\pu{ VA}]$, $P$ is the real power in [[Watt|watts]] $[\pu{ W}]$, and $Q$ is the reactive power in $[\pu{ VAR}]$. Note that VAs, watts, and VARs are all equivalent units, but we use different units to distinguish between the three types of power. The apparent power is also related to the real power through the [[Power Factor|power factor]],
$$
F_{p}=\frac{P}{S}
$$
