**Bulk modulus** is a property of solids and liquids that characterizes the response of an object to changes in a force of uniform magnitude applied perpendicularly over the entire surface of the object. An example of this is when an object is submersed in a fluid. An object subject to this type of [[Stress|stress]] is undergoes a change in [[Volume|volume]] but not in shape.
$$
K=-V\frac{dP}{dV}
$$
where $V$ is the initial volume of the object, and $\frac{dP}{dV}$ is the rate of change of the [[Pressure|pressure]] applied to the object to a change in its volume. This equation is negative because an increase in pressure will always cause a decrease in volume, thereby making $\frac{dP}{dV}$ negative. The negative sign allows us to express the bulk modulus as a positive number. The bulk modulus is the reciprocal of the [[Compressability|compressability]] of an object.
