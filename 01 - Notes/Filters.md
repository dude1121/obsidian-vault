**Filter circuits** are circuits designed to attenuate certain frequencies and not others. They come in four types: *Low Pass*, *High Pass*, *Band Pass*, and *Band Stop*.

## Low Pass

A low pass filter attenuates frequencies higher than some critical frequency $f_{c}$. $f_{c}$ can be found by finding the resonant frequency for the circuit. In the case of an R-C low-pass filter, the critical frequency is found by,
$$
f_{c}=\frac{1}{2\pi RC}
$$
