A **transcendental number** is any [[Real Numbers|real]] or [[Complex Numbers|complex]] number that is not the solution of an algebraic equation with [[Rational Numbers|rational]] coefficients. All transcendental numbers are [[Irrational Numbers|irrational]], but not all irrational numbers are transcendental. For example,
$$
x^2-2=0
$$
has the solution,
$$
x=\pm \sqrt{ 2 }
$$
Since $\sqrt{ 2 }$ is irrational but is also the solution to this [[Polynomials|polynomial]], it is not transcendental. Nearly all real and complex numbers are transcendental, but few have been proven to be transcendental. Examples of transcendental numbers include [[Euler's Number]] and [[Pi]].
