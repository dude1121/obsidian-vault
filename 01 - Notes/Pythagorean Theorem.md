**Pythagorean theorem** is a fundamental theorem that relates the three sides of a [[Right Triangle|right triangle]]. It states,
$$
a^2+b^2=c^2
$$
where $a$ and $b$ are the shorter sides (legs) of the triangle and $c$ is the [[Hypotenuse|hypotenuse]], or longest side of the triangle. It has applications ranging from rudimentary [[Geometry|geometry]] to [[Vector|vectors]] to [[Complex Numbers|complex numbers]] to [[Power#Electromagnetism|electrical power]].
