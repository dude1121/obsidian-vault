[[Genesis 5|Previous]] [[Genesis 7|Next]]
# Summary
- *2*. The "sons of God" saw the women on Earth
	- This doesn't directly say [[Angel|angels]], though it is likely that is what is implied
- *3*. God limits the lifespan of humans to 120 years.
- *4*. [[Nephilim]] are also on the earth at this time.
	- JWs teach that the sons of God and humans gave birth to the Nephilim, but this seems to imply that the Nephilim were already on the earth. (See [[Book of Enoch]])
- *5*. God sees that man is 'wicked' so he sets to kill them all in a flood.
	- The [[Flood Myth|flood myth]] is common in other middle-eastern ancient religions, possibly referencing a shared historical event.
- *13*. The main reason for God's anger is *violence*.
- *18*. In this account, [[Noah]] is told to bring only *two* of every animal.
- *21*. An oft-forgotten topic about this story is that Noah also had to preserve every plant.
# Thoughts
The text about the Nephilim is apparently expanded on in the Book of Enoch. Since [[Jude (Epistle)|Jude]] appears to quote from this book, it may be useful to read this book.

The practicalities of bringing in every animal and plant are still astounding to me and very unbelievable. Seems more mythological than literal.
