A **hydrocarbon** is an organic [[Compound|compound]] composed entirely of [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] and [[Carbon|carbon]]. Hydrocarbons can be separated into three distinct types:
1. *Saturated hydrocarbons* are hydrocarbons that have [[Single Bond|single bonds]] between their carbon atoms. They are called saturated because the single carbon - carbon bond allows the carbon to bind to three other atoms, making them bound to 4 atoms, the greatest possible number of atoms to which carbon can bond.
2. *Unsaturated hydrocarbons* are hydrocarbons that have carbon-carbon multiple bonds (these could be either [[Double Bond|double bonds]] or [[Triple Bond|triple bonds]]). 
3. *Aromatic hydrocarbons* also known as *arenes* are hydrocarbons that have at least one [[Aromatic Ring|aromatic ring]].
