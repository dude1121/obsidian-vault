In the context of magnetic circuits, **reluctance** is a measure of a material's resistance to the setting up of [[Magnetic Flux|magnetic flux]] lines through itself. It is given by,
$$
\mathcal{R}=\frac{\ell}{\mu A}
$$
where $\mathcal{R}$ is the reluctance in *rels* or Ampere-turns per Weber $[\text{At/Wb}]$ (although there is no widely accepted unit for reluctance), $\ell$ is the length of the material, $\mu$ is the [[permeability]] of the material, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the material.

Reluctance is the magnetic circuit equivalent of [[resistance]].
