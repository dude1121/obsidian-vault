A **fission reactor** is a device that is able to control a [[Nuclear Fission|nuclear fission reaction]] to produce a *self-sustained chain reaction*. The goal of this is typically to generate heat which is then in turn used to [[Nuclear Power Plant|generate electricity]]. 
# Self-sustained chain reaction
In a fission reaction with [[Uranium|uranium]] as the fuel, amongst the daughter nuclei produces there are also several [[Neutron|neutrons]] produced. These neutrons, if they are slowed enough, are then able to collide with other  uranium atoms and therefore cause more fission reactions. If uncontrolled, the energy that builds with this reaction will result in a sudden explosion of an enormous amount of energy. 

Self-sustained fission reactions were first achieved by [[Enrico Fermi]] in 1942. Fermi had placed bricks of [[Graphite|graphite]] between the fuel elements. This allowed the neutrons that were expelled from the fission reactions to collide with the [[Carbon|carbon]] nuclei and slow down until they could react with the other $\ce{^{235}U}$ [[Atom|atoms]]. In this first reactor, carbon acted as the *[[Moderator (Nuclear Reactor)|moderator]]*, helping to slow down neutrons so they can become [[Thermal Neutron|thermal neutrons]]. Modern reactors typically use [[Water|water]] or [[Heavy Water|heavy water]] as the moderator.
## Reproduction constant
To achieve a self-sustained chain reaction, an average of one neutron emitted from each $\ce{^{235}U}$ fission event must be captured by another $\ce{^{235}U}$ atom and cause that nucleus to undergo fission. A useful parameter for describing the level of reactor operations is the *reproduction constant* $K$, which is defined as the *average number of neutrons from each fission event that cause another fission event*. $K$ has an average value of $2.5$ in the uncontrolled fission of uranium.

In order for a reaction to be self-sustained, $K\geq 1$. When $K=1$, the reactor is said to be *critical*. If $K<1$, the reaction is *subcritical* and the reaction will eventually die out. If $K>1$, then the reactor is *supercritical* and a runaway reaction occurs. In a nuclear power plant, $K$ is maintained close to $1$. If it rises about $1$, then the internal energy produced could melt the reactor.
