**Angular acceleration** is the angular counterpart to linear [[Acceleration|acceleration]]. It is the [[Time|time]] [[Derivative|derivative]] of [[Angular Velocity|angular velocity]] and the second derivative of [[Angular Position|angular position]]. 
$$
\mathbf{\vec{\alpha}}=\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{\omega}}}{dt}=\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}
$$
Angular acceleration is a [[Vector|vector]] quantity whose magnitude refers to the average acceleration of the rotational motion and whose direction refers to motion along the axis of rotation. This follows the same *right hand rule* that angular velocity follows, where the fingers wrap in the direction of rotation and the thumb points in the direction of the angular velocity. If the angular speed is increasing, angular acceleration is in the same direction as angular velocity, but if angular speed is decreasing, angular acceleration and velocity have opposite directions. 

# Relation to linear acceleration
From the note on angular velocity...

![[Angular Velocity#Relation to linear velocity and acceleration]]
The linear or tangential acceleration of a point is therefore given by,
$$
\boxed{a_{t}=r\alpha}
$$
This has application to *centripetal* acceleration as well. Recall that,
$$
a_{c}=\frac{v^2}{r}
$$
Now that we have an expression for tangential velocity we can substitute that in,
$$
a_{c}=\frac{r^2\omega^2}{r}=r\omega^2
$$
The total acceleration for a rotating point is a combination of the tangential and centripetal accelerations, that is,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{a}}=\mathbf{\vec{a}}_{t}+\mathbf{\vec{a}}_{c}
$$
where $\mathbf{\vec{a}}_{t}$ has a direction pointing [[Tangent Line|tangent]] to the point under examination, and $\mathbf{\vec{a}}_{c}$ has a direction pointing towards the centre of rotation.
