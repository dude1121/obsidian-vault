A **singularity function** is a [[Function|function]] that is either discontinuous or has discontinuous derivatives. In electrical engineering there are three singularity functions that are most commonly used: the *[[Heaviside Function|step function]]*, the *[[Dirac Delta Function|delta function]]*, and the *[[Ramp Function|ramp function]]*.
