The **Aufbau principle** is a way of describing how [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]] fill up their [[Electron|electron]] [[Orbitals|orbitals]]. This principle states that in the ground state of an [[Atom|atom]], electrons will first fill subshells of the lowest available energy, then fill subshells of higher energy. For example, orbital $1s$ will be filled before any electrons are in orbital $2s$.
