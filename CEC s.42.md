# 42-002 Special terminology
**[[Duty Cycle]]** - the ratio of the time during which the [[Welder|welder]] is loaded to the total time required for one complete operation.
	- This information is typically available on the welder's nameplate given as a percentage
# 42-004 Receptacles and attachment plugs
## 1)
> Where a welder is cord-connected, the rating of the [[Receptacle|receptacle]] and attachment plug shall be permitted to be less than the rating of the [[Overcurrent Device|overcurrent devices]] protecting them, but not less than the rated primary current of the cord-connected welder.

## 2)
> Where a welder receptacle is installed, it shall be labelled to indicate
> 		a) the receptacle is intended for welder connection use only;
		b) the receptacle supply conductor [[AWG]] size;
		c) the supply conductor composition (i.e. "Cu" or "Al");
		d) the supply conductor insulation designation and its temperature rating; and
		e) the [[Amperes|ampere]] rating of the overcurrent device protecting the receptacle supply conductors based on the duty rating of the overcurrent device (i.e., $80\%$ or $100\%$).

## 42-006 Supply conductors
### 1)
> The insulated supply conductors for an individual [[Transformer|transformer]] [[Welder#Arc welder|arc welder]] or [[Welder#Inverter welder|inverter welder]] shall have an ampacity of not less than the value obtained by multiplying the rated primary current of that welder in amperes by the applicable factor from [[CEC t.42A|Table 42A]].
