A **conductor** is a material that [[Conductivity|conducts]] electricity well. Most metals are very good conductors. Conductors are single-[[Element (Chemistry)|element]] with a loosely bound valence [[Electron|electron]] which can become free electrons very easily making them available to conduct [[Current|current]]. Examples of very good conductors include [[Copper]], [[Aluminum]], [[Gold]], and [[Silver]]. 

In terms of the [[Canadian Electrical Code|CEC]], a conductor is specifically defined as, "a conductive material that is constructed for the purpose of carrying electric current."
