**Russian Marxism** is a style of [[Marxism]] that was present in the [[Russian Empire]] in the late 19th century up to the [[The October Revolution|October revolution]]. Russian Marxists were part of various groups including the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|RSDLP]] and were part of the groups that pushed for both the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|revolution in 1905]] as well as the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|two revolutions in 1917]]. 
# Russian Marxist Theory
The Russian Marxists believed at the turn of the 20th century that they had to push for two separate revolutions: first the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] revolution followed by a later [[Proletariat|proletariat]] revolution. This was due to orthodox Marxist beliefs that stated that a proletariat revolution could occur only after a capitalist bourgeois revolution. Proletariat revolution would not be ready under capitalism had "reached its maturity" which could be any time, sooner or later, after the initial bourgeois revolution (Fitzpatrick 29).
# Lead up to 1905
Before the first revolution would occur, many liberal-minded people flocked to the Marxists since there were no establish liberal anti-autocracy groups. These liberals made up a small group called the 'legal Marxists' and were headed by [[Petr Struve]]. However as 1905 approached, these liberals left the Marxists to participate in the liberal Liberation movement. 

Lenin soundly denounced the movement and was openly hostile to what he called 'bourgeois liberalism'. This opposition to liberalism was perplexing to his colleagues, but from a revolutionary perspective it was entirely logical.
