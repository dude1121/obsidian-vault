A **proton** is a [[Subatomic Particle|subatomic particle]] that resides within an [[Atom|atom's]] [[Nucleus|nucleus]]. The proton is a [[Charge|charged]] particle, having a charge equal to the [[Electron|electron]] but opposite in polarity. That is,
$$
q_{p}=+1\ \pu{ e}
$$
where $e$ is the [[Elementary Charge|elementary charge]]. The mass of a proton is,
$$
m_{p}= 1.673\times 10^{-27}\ \pu{ kg }
$$
which is slightly less than the mass of a [[Neutron|neutron]]. This mass is approximately equal to the [[Atomic Mass Unit|atomic mass unit]] $u$. 

The number of protons within an atom are what define the [[Element (Chemistry)|element]] of that atom along with its [[Atomic Number|atomic number]].

# Standard Model

Within the [[Standard Model of Physics|standard model]], protons are understood to be made up of three valence [[Quark|quarks]]: two [[Up (Quark)|up quarks]] and one [[Down (Quark)|down quark]]. Protons are classified as both [[Fermion|fermions]] and [[Hadron|hadrons]].
