**Piety** is a form of religious devotion, an act that is pleasing to a [[Deity]] or Deities.

# Euthyphro

In the [[Socrates|socratic]] dialogue [[Euthyphro]], Socrates and Euthyphro argue over the nature of piety. Euthyphro claims that things are pious because the gods love them, yet Socrates argues this point, claiming that some gods may love a thing and other gods may hate it, so something can't be pious merely because the gods love it. Therefore, something pious must be pious *because it is pious*, i.e., there is nothing that can act on something to make it *become* pious, it just *is* pious by nature.
