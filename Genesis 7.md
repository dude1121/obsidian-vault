[[Genesis 6|Previous]] [[Genesis 8|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 5*. Seems to repeat the same instructions given in [[Genesis 6|chapter 6]]. 
	- This time, Noah is told to bring *seven* pairs of clean animals instead of just two.
- *6*. Noah was 600 years old, meaning the floor was 1656 AA (After Adam, see [[Genesis 5|chapter 5]]). 
- *11*. "Fountains of the deep" - did water come from below as well as above?
- *23*. Every living thing not in the [[Noah's Ark|ark]] dies.
# Thoughts
These verses mention nothing about the dome or 'expanse' being removed, as JWs believe. Meaning, if we're to take this literally, the dome would still be here today.

Also seems unfair that only Noah survives. Does the Bible mean that there were *no* good people on all of the earth at that time? This was nearly 2000 years since creation. Seems unlikely.
