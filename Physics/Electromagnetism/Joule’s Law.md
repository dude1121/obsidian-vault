Joule's Law allows us to find the power consumed by an electrical component or entire circuit by means of one of its three primary values: [[Voltage|voltage]], [[Current|current]], and [[Resistance|resistance]]. It states,
$$
	P=VI
$$
Because of [[Ohm's Law]], we know that resistance can be related to either of voltage or current, so we can expand Joule's Law to find the following 2 other relationships:
$$P=\frac{V^2}{R}$$
$$
	P=I^2R
$$
