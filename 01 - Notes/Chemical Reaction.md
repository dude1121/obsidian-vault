A **chemical reaction** is a change in the organization of the [[Atom|atoms]] in one or more substances.

# Chemical Equations

We can write the process of a chemical reaction as an equation. For example, methane $\ce{CH_{4}}$ in natural gas, when combined with oxygen $\ce{O_{2}}$ and burned, produces [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] $\ce{CO_{2}}$ and [[Water|water]] $\ce{H_{2}O}$. This can be represented with a chemical equation. On the left side of the equation are the *reactants* and the *products* are on the right side, where both sides are separated by a right-facing arrow.
$$
\ce{CH_{4} + O_{2}-> CO_{2} + H_{2}O}
$$
Its important to remember that in a chemical reaction, all atoms present in the reactants must be accounted for among the products. There must be the same number of each type of atom on each side of the equation. Making sure this rule is obeyed is called *balancing a chemical equation*.

To make sure our above equation is balanced, let's count the atoms on each side.

| Reactant              | Count | Product               | Count |
| --------------------- | ----- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     | Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     |
| Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     | Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 2     |
| Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 2     | Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 3     |

Clearly our equation is not balanced. To fix this, we need to change the coefficients of each substance so that the atom count lines up. If we alter the equation like so,
$$
\ce{CH_{4} + 2O_{2}-> CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O}
$$
and then recount our atoms,

| Reactant              | Count | Product               | Count |
| --------------------- | ----- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     | Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     |
| Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     | Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     |
| Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 4     | Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 4     |
we now see that everything lines up, and the equation is balanced. Note that the formulas for each compound were not altered when the equation was balanced, only the coefficients. This balancing must occur due to the [[Law of Conservation of Mass]].

# Types of Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions can broadly be defined into three distinct categories: *precipitation reactions*, *acid-base reactions*, *oxidation-reduction reactions*. 

## Precipitation Reactions

When two [[Solution|solutions]] are mixed they can sometimes result a [[Solid|solid]] forming that separates from the solution. This solid that forms is called a [[Precipitate|precipitate]] and the reaction as a whole is called a *precipitation reaction*. 

Consider the reaction of potassium chromate $\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}(aq)}$ and barium nitrate $\ce{Ba(NO_{3})2(aq)}$. We can represent the mixing of these two compounds in two ways. First, we can write
$$
\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}(aq) + Ba(NO_{3})2(aq) -> products}
$$
However since in an aqueous solution these two compounds will be separated into their ions, it is more accurate to write
$$
\ce{2K+ + CrO_{4}^{2-} + Ba^{2+}(aq) + 2NO_{3}-(aq) -> products}
$$
When these two compounds are mixed, a yellow solid forms. To determine what that yellow solid is, we can look at the four ions that could possibly mix together. We know that ions with like charges will not bond, so $\ce{K+}$ and $\ce{Ba^{2+}}$ will not mix and neither will $\ce{CrO_{4}^{2-}}$ and $\ce{NO_{3}-}$. We also know that most [[Ionic Compound|ionic compounds]] contain only one anion and one cation. That means that the possible combinations are 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}}&&\ce{KNO_{3}}&&\ce{BaCrO_{4}}&&\ce{Ba(NO_{3})2}
\end{aligned}
$$
$\ce{K_{2}CrO4}$ and $\ce{Ba(NO_{3})2}$ are the reactants, so we know they're not the products. This leaves $\ce{KNO_{3}}$ and $\ce{BaCrO_{4}}$ as the possibilities. From experience, a chemist might know that $\ce{K+}$ and $\ce{NO_{3}-}$ ions are colourless, so that can't possibly be the yellow solid, meaning that $\ce{BaCrO_{4}}$ must be the yellow precipitate that forms. This means that our precipitation reaction equation is
$$
\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}(aq) + Ba(NO_{3})2(aq) -> BaCrO_{4}(s) + KNO_{3}(aq)}
$$
## Acid-Base Reactions

Acid-base reactions are also known as *neutralization reactions*. Recall that an [[Acid|acid]] produces $\ce{H+}$ when dissolved and a [[Base|base]] produces $\ce{OH-}$ when dissolved. In general, an acid can be described as a [[Proton|proton]] donor and a base is a proton acceptor.

Consider mixing an aqueous solution of [[Acetic Acid|acetic acid]] and [[Potassium Hydroxide|potassium hydroxide]]. Acetic acid is a weak electrolyte, meaning it does not dissociate into ions well. However, potassium hydroxide dissolves very well, such that before any reaction begins, we can assume it has already split into ions $\ce{K+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$. Since we know that $\ce{KOH}$ is soluble, we know there will not be any precipitation in this reaction. But since $\ce{OH-}$ is a proton acceptor, and acetic acid has a proton it could donate, the [[Hydroxide|hydroxide]] could strip the proton from the acetic acid. The net ionic equation for this reaction is therefore
$$
\ce{OH- + HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}(aq) -> H_{2}O(l) + C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}-(aq)}
$$
A general principle for acid-base reactions emerges here.

>The hydroxide ion is such a strong base that for purposes of stoichiometric calculations it can be assumed to react completely with any weak acid that it encounters.

## Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Reactions in which one or more electrons are transferred from one substance to another are called *oxidation-reduction reactions* or *redox reactions*. Everyday examples of redox reactions are [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]] in plants converting [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] and [[Water|water]] into [[Sugar|sugar]]. In fact, most reactions that result in a production of energy are redox reactions. Combustion reactions are another example of oxidation-reduction reactions. 
$$
\ce{CH_{4}(g) + 2O_{2}(g) -> CO_{2}(g) + 2H_{2}O(g) + energy}
$$
Even though none of these reactants or products are ionic, there is still a transfer of electrons from [[Carbon|carbon]] to [[Oxygen|oxygen]]. This is because of the [[Oxidation State|oxidation states]] of each atom. When describing a redox reaction, **oxidation** refers to an *increase* in oxidation state (a loss of electrons), **reduction** refers to a *decrease* in oxidation state (a gain of electrons), the **oxidizing agent** is the electron acceptor, and the **reducing agent** is the electron donor. 

In our above reaction, carbon goes from an oxidation state of $-4$ in the methane molecule to an oxidation state of $+4$ in the carbon dioxide. Oxygen goes from an oxidation state of $0$ when by itself to an oxidation state of $-2$ in both the $\ce{CO_{2}}$ and $\ce{H_{2}O}$. Hydrogen's oxidation state does not change as it is $-1$ in both methane and water. In summary then,

- Methane is *oxidized* because there is an increase in carbon's oxidation state.
- Oxygen is *reduced* because there is a decrease in its oxidation state.
- $\ce{CH4}$ is the *reducing agent*.
- $\ce{O2}$ is the *oxidizing agent*.
