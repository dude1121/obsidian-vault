For a rigid object under constant [[Angular Acceleration|angular acceleration]] we use the model of a **rigid object under constant acceleration**. Since the acceleration is constant, we can make some assumptions that allow us to use some easier equations. Note that almost all these equations are similar to the equations for a particle [[Motion under Constant Acceleration|under constant linear acceleration]], but using angular components instead of linear ones.

If angular acceleration is constant (i.e., $\mathbf{\dot{\alpha}}=0$), the following relationships hold:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\omega_{f}&=\omega_{i}+\alpha t\\
\theta_{f}&=\theta_{i}+\omega_{i}t+\frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2\\
{\omega_{f}}^2&={\omega_{i}}^2+2\alpha(\theta_{f}-\theta_{i})\\
\theta_{f}&=\theta_{i}+\frac{1}{2}(\omega_{i}+\omega_{f})t\\
\end{aligned}
$$
Note that the third equation related angular acceleration, [[Angular Velocity|angular velocity]], and [[Angular Position|angular position]] with no respect to [[Time|time]].
