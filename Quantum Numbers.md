The **quantum numbers** of an [[Atom|atom]] are numbers that describe how that [[Element (Chemistry)|element]] fills up its [[Electron|electron]] [[Orbitals|orbitals]]. There are three quantum numbers, all of which can only be integers.
# Principal quantum number ($n$)
The principal quantum number is related to the size and energy of the orbital. As $n$ increases, the orbital becomes larger and the electron spends more time farther from the [[Nucleus|nucleus]]. An increase in $n$ also means higher [[Energy|energy]] because the electron is less tightly bound to the nucleus and the energy is less negative.
# Angular momentum quantum number ($\ell$)
The [[Angular Momentum|angular momentum]] quantum number can range from $0-(n-1)$ for each value of $n$. This number is related to the shape of the orbital. The value of $\ell$ is typically assigned a letter; $\ell=0$ is $s$, $\ell=1$ is $p$, $\ell=2$ is $d$, $\ell=3$ is $f$, and $\ell=4$ is $g$. 
# Magnetic quantum number ($m_{\ell}$)
The magnetic quantum number has values between $\ell$ and $-\ell$, including zero. This value is related to the orientation of the orbital in space relative to the other orbitals in the atom.

# Electron spin quantum number ($m_{s}$)
The fourth quantum number was a later addition to the set. This is related closely to the concept of [[Quantum Spin|quantum spin]]. Since an electron can only have a spin of $+\frac{1}{2}$ or $-\frac{1}{2}$, $m_{s}$ is limited to these two values as well. Due to the [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]], this means that within one orbital there can only be at max two electrons (one with $m_{s}=+\frac{1}{2}$ and one with $m_{s}=-\frac{1}{2}$).
