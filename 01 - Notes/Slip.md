**Slip**, when referring to [[Motor|motors]], is a measure of the motor's rotational speed in reference to its synchronous speed. This measurement is important for [[Induction Machine|induction motors]], and it is typically expressed as a percentage.
$$
s=\frac{n_{s}-n}{n_{s}}\cdot 100\%
$$
Typical values for slip range between $1-10\%$, depending on the motor.
