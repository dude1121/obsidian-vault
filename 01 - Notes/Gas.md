**Gas** is a [[State of Matter|state of matter]]. It describes a [[Fluid|fluid]] that is made up of either individual [[Atom|atoms]] (a *pure* gas), [[Element (Chemistry)|elemental]] [[Molecule|molecules]] from one type of atom (e.g. [[Oxygen|oxygen]]), or [[Compound|compound]] molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]]). 
# Characteristics
Gases are much less dense than [[Liquid|liquids]] or [[Solid|solids]]. Their particles are widely separated from one another and have much weaker [[Intermolecular Bond|intermolecular bonds]] than liquids and solids. Gas movement can be described as a result of the [[Intermolecular Force|intermolecular forces]] caused by electrostatic interactions between gas particles. Like-[[Charge|charged]] areas of different gas particles repel whereas oppositely-charged areas attract.

Gases have low [[Density|density]] and [[Viscosity|viscosity]]. Gas particles will always spread apart of diffuse in order to homogenously distribute themselves throughout any container.
# Ideal gas law
Gas behaviour can be described through four main physical properties: [[Pressure|pressure]], [[Volume|volume]], [[Temperature|temperature]], and the number of particles. The [[Ideal Gas Law|ideal gas law]] combines these concepts together into the equation,
$$
PV=nRT
$$
$R$ is the [[Ideal Gas Constant|ideal gas constant]]. This law holds for normal temperature and pressure ranges, however at very low temperatures or low pressures, the volume of a *real* gas is less than the volume predicted for an ideal gas. At very high temperatures or high pressures, the volume of a *real* gas is more than the volume predicted for ideal gases.
