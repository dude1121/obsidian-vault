The **absolute value** function is a [[Function|function]] that maps any input to its positive counterpart. That is, $|3|=3=|-3|$. Technically speaking, the absolute value function is a [[Piecewise Function|piecewise function]], since it defined differently for different domains. That is,
$$
|a|=\begin{cases}
a & \text{if }a\geq 0 \\ \\
-a & \text{if }a<0
\end{cases}
$$
