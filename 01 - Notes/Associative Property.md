The **associative property** states that a binary [[Operation|operation]] (i.e. an operation with two inputs) is *associative* if rearranging the parentheses in an expression does not change the result. That is for some [[Set|set]] $S$, the operation $*$ is associative if,
$$
(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)\ \ \ \ \ \ \forall x,y,z \in S
$$
