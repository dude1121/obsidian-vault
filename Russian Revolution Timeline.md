- April 3, **Vladimir Lenin returns to Russia** and steps off the train in Petrograd.
	- Lenin had been essentially smuggled from Switzerland by the Germans because they hoped that Lenin would destabilize Russia and force them out of the war
	- Lenin's return is marked by the *April Theses*. Most important of these are his demand for the Bolsheviks to give no support to the Provisional Government nor the War as well as his promise for an abolition of the police, army, and the establishment of an SR-like land program
		- His final demand is to establish a new international which would become the Third International, or as its better known, the **Comintern**.

- August 28 - 31, **Kornilov Affair**.
	- General Lavr Kornilov is appointed by Kerensky to commander-in-chief of the Russian army after the disastrous Kerensky offensive.
	- Reports about this event are murky, but the general gist is that Kornilov brought an army of soldiers towards Petrograd with the goal of eliminating the Soviet.
	- It is unclear whether he was doing this to seize power for himself or following Kerensky's orders, but either way Kerensky did not want him to enter the city with an army
	- By August 30 many of Kornilov's men had abandoned him and the affair ended
	- As a result Kornilov is stripped of his position and thrown in prison
- October 23, the Bolshevik Central Committee meets (including Lenin) and decide now is the time for revolution.
- October 25, Bolsheviks lead an uprising against the Provisional Government kicking off the **October Revolution**.

	- Lenin and the Bolsheviks try to push a motion that the Constituent Assembly was to recognize the authority of the Bolshevik-controlled Soviets which is defeated 237-136
		- As a result, the Bolsheviks and some SRs that sided with the Bolsheviks, known as Left SRs, agree to dissolve the assembly
- The *Red Army* is established under the direction of Leon Trotsky in January
- **February 14, Russia adopts the Gregorian calendar. Dates from this point on are Gregorian!!** 
- March 3, Russia signs the **treaty of Brest-Litovsk**.
	- This is a treaty that sees Russia cede a lot of land in the Baltics, Poland, and Ukraine
	- However, it is the first international agreement made with the Bolshevik government. This *legitimizes* Soviet Russia.
- March 12, the Communists move the capital from Petrograd to Moscow.

- In response, Lenin introduces the **New Economic Plan** beginning with the end of grain requisition on March 21.
	- Lenin recognized the NEP was not socialism but he called it "state capitalism", distinguishing it from normal forms of capitalism
	- The introduction of the NEP is one of the policies Stalin will double-back on when he takes power
	- Many Bolsheviks feel the NEP is a betrayal of the revolution, whereas others like Trotsky feel it was necessary to continue the revolution
# 1922

- April 3, Joseph Stalin is made the General Secretary of the Communist Party.
- June 8 - August 7, Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries

- May, Lenin has his first stroke
- October 25, Vladivostock is captured by the Red Army, ending the Russian Civil War
