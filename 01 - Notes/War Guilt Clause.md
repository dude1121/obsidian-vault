The **War Guilt clause**, formally known as **Article 231**, was a part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that served "as a legal basis under which Germany was to pay reparations for damages caused during the war." It stated:
> [!quote] Article 231, Treaty of Versailles
> The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.

According to the allies, this clause was not so much them blaming Germany for all of world war I[^1] but rather them establishing a legal basis for the reparations they laid out in the rest of the treaty. The Germans however took offence to this clause, arguing that they were not solely responsible for the war and therefore should not be expected to pay the amount the allies were requesting.

Regardless of the intent of the allies, the result was clear: Germany had felt slighted by the allies and, whether or not the allies thought Germany had single-handedly caused the war, they did ask for an incredible amount of money, something that no country at that time would have been able to repay, never mind Germany. It should be noted though that the historical consensus is that this clause was not in fact the cause of the rise of [[Nazi Party|Nazism]] but rather other, unrelated reasons could explain this.

[^1]: Similar clauses were added to treaties with the other former Central Powers yet they did not cause the same uproar.
