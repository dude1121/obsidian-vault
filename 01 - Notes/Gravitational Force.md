The [[Force|force]] acting on an object due to [[Gravity|gravity]] is known as the **gravitational force**. It is defined as a special case of [[Newton's Laws|Newton's second law]]. The force is given by,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{g}=m\mathbf{\vec{g}}
$$
where $\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{g}$ is the force acting on the object and $\mathbf{\vec{g}}$ is the acceleration due to gravity on [[Earth]] ($\approx 9.801\pu{ m/s^2}$).
