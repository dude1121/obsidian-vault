The **ideal gas law** is an equation of state for a [[Gas|gas]]. Its most familiar form is,
$$
PV=nRT
$$
where, $P$ is the [[Pressure|pressure]] of the gas, $V$ is the [[Volume|volume]] of the gas, $n$ is the amount of the gas in [[Mole|moles]] $[\pu{ mol}]$, $T$ is the [[Temperature|temperature]] of the gas in [[Kelvin|kelvin]] $[\pu{ K}]$, and $R$ is the [[Ideal Gas Constant|ideal gas constant]] with a value of
$$
R=0.08206\pu{ \! L\cdot atm/K\cdot mol }
$$
This law is a combination of three previously discovered laws related to gases, that of [[Boyle's Law|Boyle's law]], [[Charles' Law|Charles' law]], and [[Avogadro's Law|Avogadro's law]].

The ideal gas law tells us that if we know three properties of a gas (i.e. three of pressure, volume, temperature, no. particles) we can completely define the gas since the fourth property can be found via the ideal gas law.
