**Gauss's law**, or sometimes **Gauss's flux theorem**, is one of [[Maxwell's Equations|Maxwell's equations]]. It is an application of the [[Divergence#Fundamental theorem for divergences|fundamental theorem for divergences]] and it relates to the distribution of electric [[Charge|charge]] of a resulting [[Electric Field|electric field]].

Put simply, Gauss's law states:
$$
\Phi_{E}=\frac{Q}{\varepsilon_{0}}
$$
where $\Phi_{E}$ is the [[Electric Field#Field lines|electric flux]], $Q$ is the total *enclosed* charge, and $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[Permittivity|permittivity of free space]]. The flux is through a closed surface $\mathcal{S}$ enclosing some volume $\mathcal{V}$. It is therefore a [[Surface Integral|surface integral]] of the electric field,
$$
\Phi_{E}=\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}
$$
Putting this together we get the *integral form of Gauss's law:*
$$
\boxed{\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{a}=\frac{Q_{\mathrm{enc}}}{\varepsilon_{0}}}
$$
The enclosed charge can also be defined as the [[Charge Density|charge density]] $\rho$ integrated over the entire volume $\mathcal{V}$. Therefore we can also express this as,
$$
\boxed{\oint_{\mathcal{S}}\mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{a}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}}\int_{\mathcal{V}}\rho\ d\tau}
$$
We can express Gauss's law in differential form as well as,
$$
\boxed{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}}\rho}
$$
