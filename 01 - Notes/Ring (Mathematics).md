A **ring** in mathematics is a [[Set|set]] equipped with two binary operations satisfying properties similar to [[Addition|addition]] and [[Multiplication|multiplication]] of [[Integer|integers]]. Ring [[Element (Mathematics)|elements]] may be [[Number|numbers]] or may be non-numerical such as [[Polynomial|polynomials]], [[Square Matrix|square matrices]], [[Function|functions]], or [[Power Series|power series]]. 

A ring $R$ must satisfy the following [[Axiom|axioms]]:
1. $[R;+]$ is an [[Abelian Group|abelian group]].
2. Multiplication is [[Associative Property|associative]] on $R$
3. Multiplication is [[Distributive Property|distributive]] over addition; i.e. for all $a, b,c\ \in R$, the left distributive law ($a\cdot(b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c$) and the right distributive law ($(b+c)\cdot a=b\cdot a+c\cdot a$). 

A ring is typically denoted as $[R;+,\cdot]$ but may also be written $R$ if the operations are understood.
