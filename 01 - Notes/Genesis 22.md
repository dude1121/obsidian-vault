[[Genesis 21|Previous]] [[Genesis 23|Next]]
# Summary
- *2*. God tells [[Abraham]] to take [[Isaac]] to sacrifice on a mountain in the land of Moriah.
- *5*. Abraham tells his men "we will return to you," implying he knew or expected God to arrange an alternative sacrifice.
	- JWs say this is because he expected God to [[Resurrection|resurrect]] Isaac should he die, but a this point a resurrection had never occurred and Abraham would have no reason to expect this of God.
- *8*. Was Abraham expressing faith in God? Or was he lying as he often did?
	- This critique feels harsh in hindsight. Abraham likely said this to comfort his son, but also it wasn't entirely deceitful. God *had* provided the lamb, Isaac just wasn't aware that *he* was the lamb.
- *10*. Abraham about to kill Isaac.
- *12*. An [[Angel|angel]] intervenes.
- *13*. Abraham spots a ram and sacrifices that instead.
- *14*. Abraham names the spot where he almost sacrifices Isaac '[[Jehovah-Jirah]]' meaning '[[Yahweh]] will provide.'
- *17*. God reaffirms his promise to Abraham to make his offspring numerous.

# Thoughts
The requirement for Abraham to sacrifice Isaac feels cruel. Even though God stepped in and stopped Abraham from following through, he still allowed it to progress to this point, and he still gave the command. Genesis paints God as quite cruel at times; there had to have been a better way for Abraham to prove his faith.
