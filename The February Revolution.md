The **February Revolution** was a [[Revolution|revolution]] that started in February 1917 ([[Russian Old Style Calendar|O.S.]])[^1] in [[Petrograd]]. It resulted in the overthrow of the imperial government, the [[Abdication of Tsar Nicholas II|abdication of the Tsar]], and the installation of the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]] along with the [[Petrograd Soviet]]. 
# Background
[[World War I]] was especially hard on the Russian people. The fourth [[Duma]] saw a majority form of centre and moderate right representatives proposed the creation of a coalition government, a reform which the Tsar rejected outright and dissolved the Duma on September 3, 1915.

The Tsar had also assumed direct command of the armies a few days earlier, leaving his wife, [[Empress Alexandra]] in control in Petrograd. Alexandra herself was under the influence of [[Rasputin]], something many of the elites in Russia despised.[^2] Rasputin himself was murdered on the night of December 16-17, 1916 by a group of conservative nobles as an attempt to get the nobility to wake up and do something to help the people.

The Russian military had also suffered massive defeats and heavy losses, notably the [[The Brusilov Offensive|Brusilov Offensive]] as well as the [[Battle of Tannenberg]], the [[Winter Battle in Masuria]], and the loss of [[Russian Poland]]. By January 1917, Russia had suffered nearly six million casualties. When these wounded soldiers returned from the front and saw the deplorable conditions in Petrograd, they became radicalized. 
# Revolution
On February 23, 1917, the revolution officially begins. However, this was not the plan for many revolutionaries. February 23 was International Women's Day, and on this day the predominantly female workforce rose up and began striking across Petrograd. The strikes initially began as demands for higher wages, but this spiralled into something much larger. However, at the time, the members of the Duma and the local police did not give the strikes much notice.

The strikes continued the next day, and likely amounted to 30% of the total Petrograd workforce. Some sections of this crowd were successful in reaching the city centre. Some students also joined the protests.

On the third day, February 25, the strike becomes a general strike. The strikers become aggressive, raiding police stations and disarming the police force. The general strike turned into an armed uprising. Sergey Khabalov, the military governor of Petrograd, was given orders from the Tsar to suppress the strike. Nicholas also sent word to the Prime Minister [[Nikolai Golitsyn]] to dissolve the Duma.

The next day, Khabalov tried to disperse the crowds and he was temporarily successful with a lot of demonstrators shot. This use of force however may have served to simply intensify the efforts of the protesters. Several regiments of the Imperial Guard had revolted and joined the demonstrators causing Khabalov to send a group of 1000 troops under command of Col. [[Alexander Kutepov]]. This was an abject failure as Kutepov's men came into contact with the mutinous soldiers and joined their side. The ministers in the Winter Palace tried to hide themselves but to no avail. They were arrested and imprisoned on February 27, 1917.
