**Newton's laws** are three laws of [[Motion|motion]] described by English physicist [[Isaac Newton]]. Together they form the basis of classical mechanics.

# First Law

Newton's first law is sometimes referred to the law of [[Inertia|inertia]]. It is sometimes worded as,

>[!quote] Newton's First Law
>If no force acts on an object, an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion.

Put more technically,

>[!quote] Newton's First Law
>If an object does not interact with other objects, it is possible to identify a reference frame in which the object has zero acceleration. In the absence of external forces and when viewed from an inertial reference frame, an object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion continues in motion with a constant velocity.

From just the first law then, it becomes clear that [[Force|force]] is what makes an object change its motion.

# Second Law

Newton's second law states:

>[!quote] Newton's Second Law
>When viewed from an inertial reference frame, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

In other words,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{a}}\propto \frac{\sum\mathbf{\vec{F}}}{m}
$$
So long as the [[Speed|speed]] of the object is much less than the [[Speed of Light|speed of light]] we can assume the proportionality constant is 1, meaning
$$
\sum \mathbf{\vec{F}}=m\mathbf{\vec{a}}
$$
Interestingly, this is not the original wording of this law. Newton originally described his second law with the relation that the net force was directly proportional to the time [[Derivative|rate of change]] of an object's [[Linear Momentum|linear momentum]].
$$
\sum \mathbf{\vec{F}}=\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{p}}}{dt}
$$
# Third Law

The third law is often stated as "every action has an equal and opposite reaction". Expressing this more directly,

>[!quote] Newton's Third Law
>If two objects interact, the force $\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{12}$ exerted by object $1$ on object $2$ is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force $\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{21}$ exerted by object $2$ on object $1$.
>$$
>\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{12}=-\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{21}
>$$

In all cases, the action and reaction forces must act on *different* objects and must be of the same type. I.e., an electromagnetic force can not result in a gravitational reaction.
