A **polar molecule** is a molecule that has an uneven distribution of [[Charge|charge]] and as such has a centre of positive charge $\delta^+$ and a centre of negative charge $\delta^-$. Molecules that behave in this way are referred to as **dipoles** or as having a **dipole moment**. 

The charges in a molecule may be represented by an electrostatic potential diagram, with red indicating [[Electron|electron]]-rich areas of the dipole and blue indicating electron-poor regions. For example, below is the electrostatic potential diagram for [[Hydrogen Fluoride|hydrogen fluoride]].

Polar bonds between elements with greater differences in [[Electronegativity|electronegativity]] will result in larger dipole moments. Not every molecule with polar bonds is necessarily a dipole, however. For example, consider [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]]. $\ce{CO_{2}}$ is a [[VESPR Molecule Structures|linear]] molecule with two identical bonds.

These bonds are on opposite sides of the [[Carbon|carbon]] atom. While the individual carbon-[[Oxygen|oxygen]] bonds are polar, the opposing bond polarities cancel out. This means that carbon dioxide does not have a dipole moment. There is no preferred orientation for this molecule to line up in an [[Electric Field|electric field]].

In general, there are three molecular structures that will result in no dipole moment: linear with two identical bonds, planar with three identical bonds $120\degree$ apart, and tetrahedral molecules with four identical bonds $109.5\degree$ apart.
