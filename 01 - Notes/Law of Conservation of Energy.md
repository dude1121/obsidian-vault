**The law of conservation of energy** states,
>[!quote] Conservation of Energy
>In an isolated system, the total [[Energy|energy]] must remain constant. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another.

For example, when a stick of [[Dynamite|dynamite]] explodes, [[Chemical Energy|chemical energy]] is converted into [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]]. Due to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[Mass-Energy Equivalence|mass-energy equivalence]], the law of conservation of energy is closely tied with the [[Law of Conservation of Mass|law of conservation of mass]].
