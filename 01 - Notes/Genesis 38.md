[[Genesis 37|Previous]] [[Genesis 39|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. [[Judah (Person)|Judah]] settles away from his family.
- *2*. He then marries the daughter of a [[Canaan|Canaanite]] named Shua.
- *3 - 5*. Through this unnamed woman Judah has three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah.
- *6*. Judah takes [[Tamar]] as a wife for Er.
- *7*. Er was however "wicked" so God kills him.
- *8*. Judah instructs Onan to perform "the duty of a brother-in-law" to Tamar
	- [[King James Version|KJV]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]], and [[Septuagint|LXX]] interpret this as Onan marrying Tamar. LXX says "marry her as her brother-in-law."
- *9*. This is the custom of *Levirate marriage* (see [[Deuteronomy]] [[Deuteronomy 25|25.5-10]]). According to the custom, "the duty of the brother-in-law was to father a son for his deceased brother and thus perpetuate his name and inheritance." ([[New Oxford Annotated Bible|NOAB]]) Onan refuses to sire children not of his line so he pulls out.
- *10*. Because Onan did not respect levirate marriage, God kills Onan.
- *12*. Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, dies.
- *13 - 14*. Tamar follows Judah to Timnah and disguises herself as a prostitute.
	- The wording of the verse seems to imply that she is plotting to sleep with Judah and extort him as revenge for her not being given Shelah despite him being of age now.
- *16 - 19*. Tamar asks for a pledge from Judah before sleeping with him. He pledges to give her a kid from his flock, as well as his signet, the cord along with the signet, and his staff. Tamar conceives from Judah due to this encounter.
- *20 - 23*. Judah returns the next day to pay what he pledged to the prostitute he slept with only to find that, not only is she not there, but the townspeople say there has never been a prostitute outside this temple. Judah resolves to let her keep his signet and staff for fear of further humiliation.
- *24*. Three months later, Judah finds out that Tamar has been whoring around and that she is pregnant because of it. 
	- Judah initially suggests she should be burned because of her activity. This is a double standard, however, since Judah paid for these services. Shouldn't he too be killed?
- *25 - 26*. Before Judah can have Tamar killed, she presents him the signet, cord, and staff, proving that it was she who he slept with and that he is the father of her child. Judah does not kill her when he learns this and says that she is in the right since he did not give Shelah to her.
- *27 - 30*. Tamar gives birth to twins: [[Perez]] and [[Zerah]].
# Thoughts
Again we see double standards between men and women in the bible, with Judah suggesting Tamar be killed for being a prostitute yet he does not feel he should receive any punishment for seeking out a prostitute.
