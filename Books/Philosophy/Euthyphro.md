- Dialogue between Euthyphro and [[Socrates]]. 
- Both are about to be engaged in court cases: Euthyphro is prosecuting his father for the murder of a slave that himself was also a murderer, and Socrates is being prosecuted by [[Meletus]] ([[Five Dialogues]], p. 2)
- Euthyphro has been accused of [[Impiety|impiety]] for prosecuting his father.
- Socrates asks Euthyphro if the man his father killed was his relative. Euthyphro responds by saying it does not matter whether the man his father killed was a relative or not. What matters is whether the action was [[Justice|just]], and if not, Euthyphro himself would share in the blame or "pollution" if he did not bring his father to justice.

> It is ridiculous, Socrates, for you to think that it makes any difference whether the victim is a stranger or a relative. One should only watch whether the killer acted justly or not; if he acted justly, let him go, but if not, one should prosecute, if, that is to say, the killer shares your hearth and table. The pollution is the same if you knowingly keep company with such a man and do not cleanse yourself and him by bringing him to justice.

- This sounds vaguely familiar to verses in the [[New Testament]].
- Euthyphro claims he has the superior knowledge on what is [[Piety|pious]]. It is unclear if he is taunting him or not, but Socrates says he should become Euthyphro's pupil to learn from him what is pious and what is impious, so that he can tell Meletus to prosecute Euthyphro instead of him.
- Euthyphro thinks his action pious because it mirrors what [[Zeus]] did to [[Cronus]], and what [[Cronus]] did to [[Uranus (God)|Uranus]]. He says that since the gods held their own fathers accountable for their misdeeds, that it is pious for Euthyphro to prosecute his father for this crime. (p. 6-7)
- Socrates then presses Euthyphro on what piety really is (p. 8) and Euthyphro's definition is "*What is dear to the gods is pious, what is not is impious*".
- Socrates counters this by reasoning that the gods, if they are similar to man, must argue over many things, sometimes trivial things like beauty, and sometimes ethical issues about what is right and wrong. If piety is based solely on what the gods like, then everything is pious but at the same time impious, since the gods argue about everything. (p. 9)
- Euthyphro tries to reason that all the gods would agree that unjust killing is impious, but Socrates says that nobody would deny that, but that in court the debate is over if the killing was unjust, or who committed the crime, etc. 
- Socrates asks Euthyphro now if all the gods find something good, does that make it pious? He at first asks Euthyphro to prove to him that the gods think his specific situation is just, but he realizes this is a circular argument and instead asks "*is this the correction we are making in our discussion, that what all the gods hate is impious, and what they love is pious, and that what some gods love and others hate is neither or both? Is that now how you wish us to define piety and impiety?*"
- This spurs another question: Is something pious because the gods love it, or do the gods love it because it is pious?

>I want to say this, namely, that if anything is being changed or is being affected in any way, it is not being changed because it is something changed, but rather it is something changed because it is being changed; nor is it being affected because it is being affected, but it is something affected because it is being affected.

- Socrates arrives at his final point, that piety is different from these examined cases
>[!quote] Euthyphro, p. 13
>What then do we say about the pious, Euthyphro? Surely that it is being loved by all the gods, according to what you say?... It is being loved then because it is pious, but it is not pious because it is being loved... And yet it is something loved and god-loved because it is being loved by the gods?... Then the god-loved is not the same as the pious... \[because] the pious is being loved for this reason, that it is pious, but it is not pious because it is being loved... the god-loved, on the other hand, is so because it is being loved by the gods, by the very fact of it being loved, but it is not loved because it is god-loved.

- The point of Socrates' argument here is that something is pious because it is pious, i.e., piety is a concept in and of itself. It has nothing to do with it being god-loved. Anything god-loved is not god-loved for its own sake, it is god-loved because the gods love it. These two ideas are at odds. Piety is god-loved, but god-loved $\neq$ piety.
- Euthyphro claims Socrates is moving their conversation in circles. Socrates instead says it is Euthyphro himself making the argument rotate, and compares him to [[Daedelus]]. (p. 14)
- Socrates then asks Euthyphro if pious is necessarily just. He compares this to a saying by an unknown author,
>[!quote] Euthyphro, p. 15
>You do not with to name Zeus, who had done it, and who made all things grow, **for where there is fear there is also shame.**

- Socrates takes issue with this last part, and instead says that not all fear is shameful, for if someone is afraid of poverty or disease he is not ashamed of this, yet all shame has fear, since if something brings someone shame there is a fear that comes along with it.
	- Not all fear is shame, but all shame is fear.
	- All odd numbers are numbers, but not all numbers are odd.
	- All spiders are arachnids, but not all arachnids are spiders. <-- My addition
- Euthyphro agrees that piety is a part of justice and Socrates asks him which part of justice is piety. (p. 16)
	- For example, one can easily explain which numbers are even, i.e. that they are divisible by 2. Similarly, if piety is part of justice, there must be some way to describe which part specifically is piety.
- At first, Euthyphro says that piety is the care of the gods. Socrates likens this to how cattle breeding is the care of cattle, hunters are caretakers of dogs, etc. 
	- Socrates challenges this by asking what care or benefit do humans give to the gods. Does one's being pious make the gods better?
- Euthyphro then shifts gears, claiming that piety is the service of the gods, like slaves to a master or soldiers to a general.
	- Socrates challenges this as well, by asking what is the ultimate aim of this service, since both a master and a general have a goal in mind with this service.
- Euthyphro says this service is made up by prayer and sacrifice.
	- Socrates then reasons that this means that piety is knowing how to beg and give to the gods. He compares this type of piety to a sort of trading skill, knowing what to ask for and give. 
- Socrates asks what the gods get in exchange for this. Euthyphro answers "honour, reverence" and that it "pleases them".
	- This is, of course, more circular reasoning, because it was established previously that piety and the god-loved are different, but now Euthyphro has defined piety as that which is pleasing to the gods.
