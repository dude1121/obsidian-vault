A **microprocessor** is a [[Computer|computer]] [[Processor|processor]] for which the data processing logic and control is contained within a single [[Integrated Circuit|integrated circuit]] (IC). The IC will contain the [[Arithmetic Logic Unit|ALU]] and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a basic [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]]. It can interpret and execute [[Program|program]] instructions and perform basic arithmetic operations. It accepts [[Binary|binary]] data as input and according to any instructions stored in its [[Memory|memory]], it provides a result as an output. 

A microprocessor differs from a [[Microcontroller|microcontroller]] in that it only contains the CPU and no other peripherals, whereas a microcontroller may contain additional peripherals like [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] or additional CPU cores.
