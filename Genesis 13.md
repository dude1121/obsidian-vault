[[Genesis 12|Previous]] [[Genesis 14|Next]]
# Summary
- *3*. [[Abraham|Abram]] travels back to where they were before in [[Genesis 12|Gen 12.8]].
- *7*. Once again, we see this "at that time" referring to the [[Canaan|Canaanites]] living in the land.
- *8 - 12*. Abram and [[Lot]] split. Abram settles in Canaan and Lot settles near [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]].
- *13*. This verse foreshadows the story in [[Genesis 19|chapter 19]].
- *14 - 17*. God promises the land of Canaan to Abram's "seed."
# Thoughts
Only thing I have to note is the weird writing style that seems to disprove Moses' authorship.
