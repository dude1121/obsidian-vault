Current is the flow of [charge](Charge.md). It is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Amperes]], or Amps \[$\text{A}$].
$$ I=\frac{Q}{t} $$
where $I$ is the current in amps \[A] (we use $I$ for current from the French, intensité du courant), $Q$ is the charge in Coulombs \[C], and $t$ is time in seconds \[s]. We could more accurately describe this relationship through calculus as,
$$ I=\frac{dQ}{dt}=\dot{Q} $$
Although we know now that current actually flows from negative to positive, it was originally thought that current flowed from positive to negative. This is referred to as “conventional current flow” and it is the standard for electrical engineering and circuit analysis.
