A **junction field effect transistor** or **JFET** is a type of [[Field Effect Transistor|field effect transistor]]. It differs from the [[Metal Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor|MOSFET]] in that as a gate voltage is applied to the FET the conduction channel *narrows* whereas in a MOSFET this channel *widens* as a gate voltage is applied. This functionally means that MOSFETs and JFETs operate opposite to one another; JFETs conduct when there is no gate voltage and get less [[Conductivity|conductive]] as more voltage is applied whereas MOSFETs do not conduct until the gate voltage reaches some threshold voltage after which the conductivity *increases* with gate voltage.

Like most transistors, there are two types of JFETs: *n*-channel or *p*-channel. This distinction refers to which type of [[Semiconductor Doping|doped semiconductor]] forms the conduction channel.

The JFET always operates with the gate-source [[PN Junction|pn junction]] reverse biased. This means that a JFET is a normally on device, and an applied gate voltage will cause the JFET to become less conductive until it turns off entirely.
