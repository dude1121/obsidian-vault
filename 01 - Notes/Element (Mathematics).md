In mathematics, an **element** of a [[Set|set]] is any one of the objects that belong to that set. For example, if we defined the set $A$ as $A=\{1,2,3,4\}$, then $3$ would be an element of $A$, something we might express as,
$$
3 \in A
$$
The number of elements within a given set is known as the set's [[Cardinality|cardinality]]. In the example above, the cardinality of set $A$ is 4. We might express this as,
$$
|A|=4
$$
