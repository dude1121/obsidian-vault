A **Generator** is a machine that converts [[Mechanical Energy|mechanical energy]] into [[Electrical Energy|electrical energy]]. It can be configured to produce both [[DC Electricity]] and [[AC Electricity]]. 

A generator works based off [[Faraday's Law]].
$$
\mathcal{E}=N\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}
$$
A generator can either be a [[DC Machine|dc machine]] or a [[Synchronous Machine|synchronous machine]]. Technically an [[Induction Machine|induction machine]] can also be run as a generator but in most cases the dc or sync machines are used.
