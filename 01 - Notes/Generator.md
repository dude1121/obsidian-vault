A **Generator** is a machine that converts [[Mechanical Energy|mechanical energy]] into [[Electrical Energy|electrical energy]]. It can be configured to produce both [[DC Electricity]] and [[AC Electricity]]. 

A generator works based off [[Faraday's Law]].
$$
\mathcal{E}=N\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}
$$
A generator can either be a [[DC Machine|dc machine]] or a [[Synchronous Machine|synchronous machine]]. Technically an [[Induction Machine|induction machine]] can also be run as a generator but in most cases the dc or sync machines are used.

# Power Flow

In a typical generator the input power is some form of mechanical energy. In high voltage power distribution such as a [[Power Grid|power grid]], this input is typically a [[Turbine|turbine]] which is spun by steam power. This mechanical input power is then converted into [[Real Power|real electrical power]]. This process is not 100% efficient, however, and there are some losses. In addition to this, some generators such as synchronous generators or separately excited dc generators require external dc power to energize the magnetic field. 

The output power of a generator is typically given by,
$$
P_{o}=EI
$$
for single phase, or
$$
P_{o}=3E_{\Phi}I_{\Phi}
$$
for three phase.
