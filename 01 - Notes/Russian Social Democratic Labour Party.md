The **Russian Social Democratic Labour Party** (**RSDLP**) was a [[Socialism|socialist]] political party in the [[Russian Empire]]. It was founded in 1898 in Minsk as a result of various [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups coming together and had the purpose of establishing a socialist state. 

In 1903 the party had a large split into two different factions: the [[Bolshevik Party|Bolsheviks]] led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the [[Menshevik Party|Mensheviks]], lead primarily by [[Julius Martov]]. Both factions remained part of the same party for some time, however, and the RSDLP became a true workers' movement despite its beginnings as an intelligentsia-led party. True, the leaders of the party still came from that class but the majority of members and activists were workers.
# Bolshevik-Menshevik split
In 1903 at the second Russian Social Democratic Party congress, a dispute arose over the composition of the editorial board of the party's newspaper: *Iskra*. The split was principally between two men: Vladimir Lenin and Julius Martov. The dispute led into disagreement about what it meant to be a member of the RSDLP. Martov held that a member was one who "accepts its \[the party's\] program and supports it both materially and by regular cooperation under the leadership of one of its organizations." Lenin had proposed a stricter definition, claiming that a party member needs to not only support the party's program but also personally participate in one of the party's organizations.

Initially, Martov won the vote 28-23. However, 5 of those votes came from the [[Bundist|Bundists]] who later exited the party, giving Lenin's side the majority. This vote was the origin of the terms Bolshevik (большинство, meaning 'majority') and Menshevik (меньшинство, meaning 'minority'). It is significant to note that [[Leon Trotsky]] was initially a member of the Mensheviks.
