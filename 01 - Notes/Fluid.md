A **fluid** is a collection of [[Molecule|molecules]] that are randomly arranged and held together by weak cohesive [[Force|forces]] and by forces exerted by the walls of a container. Both [[Liquid|liquids]] and [[Gas|gases]] are fluids.

Fluids, unlike [[Solid|solids]], do not experience [[Shear Modulus|shearing]] or [[Young's Modulus|tensile]] [[Stress|stresses]]. The only stress therefore that can be exerted on an object submerged in a static fluid is one that compresses the object from all sides. I.e., the force exerted by a static fluid on an object is always perpendicular to the surfaces of the object.

The amount of force exerted on a surface of the object divided by the area of that surface is the definition of [[Pressure|pressure]]. That is,
$$
P=\frac{F}{A}
$$
