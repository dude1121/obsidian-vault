The **Bosnian crisis** was one of the events that lead up to [[World War I]]. It occurred on October 5, 1908 when [[Austria-Hungary]] announced the annexation of the former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. The province had been under Austrian military occupation since 1878 after the [[Russo-Turkish War]].

The annexation was timed to coincide with the [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] declaration of independence on the same day and it sparked outrage from the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] due primarily to the large number or Serbs within Bosnia. The crisis was "resolved" in April 1909 when the [[Treaty of Berlin]] was revised to cede Bosnian territory to the Austro-Hungarians. Although essentially being a victory for Austria, this led to strained relationships between Austria-Hungary and its neighbours, primarily Serbia and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].
# Russian inaction
Russia, being an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] state, saw itself as the protector of the orthodox states that began declaring their independence as the Ottoman Empire fell into decline. Russia also had interest in having territory in the Mediterranean. 

After the treaty of Berlin, the Ottomans maintained control of the [[Dardanelles]] which prevented the Russian navy access to the Mediterranean. This led foreign secretary [[Alexander Izvolsky]] to engage with Austro-Hungarian foreign minister [[Alois Aehrenthal]] in discussions about a deal between the two nations: Austria could formally annex Bosnia as they had been wanting to do for years now[^1] with no Russian intervention and Russia could gain access to the Dardanelles with Austria's support. 

In September of 1908, Aehrenthal told the Austo-Hungarian council that Russia would support Austrian annexation of Bosnia. While the premiers of Austria and Hungary both had their own misgivings, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]] was on board and he gave the plan his blessing. 

Somewhere along the line, the wires got crossed between the two diplomats. It appears that Izvolsky was under the impression that the signatories of the Treaty of Berlin would have to agree with these arrangements and that Aehrenthal had agreed to an international conference, something the Austrian apparently did not agree to. After their meeting in mid-September 1908, Izvolsky set off to Paris and London to get approval from the other signatories, only to find out while still in Paris that annexation would be soon underway.

This left Russia in a bad position. Not only did it appear they had sold out their Slav brothers in Bosnia, France and Britain did not go along with plans for a Russian naval presence in the Dardanelles, meaning Russia got absolutely nothing out of this deal except bad PR. Izvolsky accused Aehrenthal of treachery and of violating his pledge.

Russia turned on Izvolsky, and then-Prime Minister [[Pyotr Stolypin]] even threatened to resign over the matter. Russia denounced the annexation and blamed Germany, not Austria, for the crisis.
