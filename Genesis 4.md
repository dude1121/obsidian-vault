# Thoughts
Not much here strikes me.

The mark of Cain is intriguing as it is never talked about. This family tree also differs from the one in [[Genesis 5|chapter 5]]. 

There is often much emphasis put on how Abel's sacrifice was accepted because of his 'heart condition' but Genesis makes no mention of that.
