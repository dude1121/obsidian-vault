**World War I** (**WWI**), also known as **The Great War**, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. While the conflict was primarily focused in continental Europe, there was fighting all over the globe, hence the name *World* War I.
# Setting the stage
The time period before war was known as the *belle Ã©poque*, literally the 'beautiful era.' In Europe, especially Western Europe, it was characterized by long periods of peace. Retrospectively, this era was noted as the 'good old days' before the decades of conflict known as world war I and [[World War II|II]]. 

In this time we see the rise of impressionism in art, theatre became more direct and expressionism rose in popularity. Authors like James Joyce became leading European writers of the time.

This time period also corresponds to the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. England had primarily been the beneficiary of the [[First Industrial Revolution]] and began this era must more industrialized than their neighbours. However, by the time we get to 1914, the United States and [[German Empire|Germany]] are the most industrialized nations.

This revolution led to more dangerous jobs. Factories became the primary source of income for business owners and workers alike. Labourers moved from the field to the factory floor and faced harsh conditions with no restriction on working hours, no minimum wage, and no worker protections. Children often were employed since they could be paid less than men and could fit in places adults could not easily work in.

This period sees the introduction of something called *efficiency management* primarily by Frederick Winslow Taylor.
## Taylorism
Taylor had the idea that efficiency was the most important metric in a business. Workers should be selected based on their existing abilities or their ability to be trained. However this led to the bottom line of businesses being prioritized over worker's health.

This idea of Taylorism did help to increase worker's wages eventually, and consumer goods became cheaper and more available. However, the wealth gap between the labourers and their bosses began to grow. Businessmen, or as they'd be known, *capitalists*, started amassing wealth. The middle class began to emerge and moving away from city centres and into what would become the suburbs. This physical distance between the classes became greater with Henry Ford and the invention of the car, allowing them to travel larger distances.
# Rise of socialism
Thinkers like [[Emile Durkheim]] and [[Karl Marx]] emerge and place blame on social issues and problems of the 19th century on industrialism and, in particular, capitalism.

Marx argues that capitalism was the root cause of all of society's problems and that it should be abandoned in favour of a system he called [[Communism|communism]]. He believed that everything came down to a struggle between not peoples or races or cultures, but *class*.

## New era of imperialism
At this time much of the "new world" has been conquered by Europe. Whereas colonialism and imperialism before was taking land that Europe felt was "unclaimed." By this time, however, expanding imperial aims means fighting another European power for their claimed land in places like Africa, Asia, or the Americas.

We had already seen some former colonies achieve some sort of independence before this point: the United States (1776), Brazil (1822), Australia and New Zealand (1850s) and Canada (1867). Now, however, while some felt that imperialism was old hat, the nations of Europe once again turned their attention to colonial ambitions.

This was for many reasons: mercantilism, nationalism, and diplomatic reasons. Mercantilism gave nations the idea that if they controlled all or most of the resources they will be the most powerful. Nationalism motivated states to conquer more territory for "King and Country" as a sense of national pride. Then there is the diplomatic reason: if all the other nations in Europe are doing it, we'll fall behind if we don't. 

This increase in imperialism in Africa is known as the [[Scramble for Africa]] and it resulted in the entire continent going from about $10\%$ European control in 1870 to nearly $90\%$ in 1914.

Social Darwinism also made an impact. This was a racist ideology that bastardized the concept of natural selection proposed by [[Charles Darwin]]. It implied that white people were superior because of their technological successes and military prowess. They felt they had an obligation to "civilize" other peoples whom they referred to as "savages."
