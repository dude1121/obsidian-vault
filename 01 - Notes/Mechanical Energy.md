**Mechanical energy** is the sum of [[Potential Energy|potential]] and [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic]] energy in a given system. 
$$
E_{\text{m}}=K+U
$$
Due to the [[Law of Conservation of Energy|law of conservation of energy]], the total mechanical energy within an isolated system subjected only to [[Conservative Force|conservative forces]] must remain unchanged.
