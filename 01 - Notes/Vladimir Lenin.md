**Vladimir Lenin** was a Russian revolutionary and the first head of state of [[Soviet Russia]] from 1917 to 1924 (and by extension the head of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1924).
# Early Life
Lenin is born in Simbirsk. He embraces revolutionary activity after his other brother Aleksandr was hanged for plotting to assassinate Tsar [[Alexander III]]. He earned a law degree and moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893. He becomes a prominent Marxist activist and is exiled for this in 1897 to [[Siberia]]. 
# Activism
After his exile, Lenin becomes a leading figure in the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. In 1903, the party splits between Lenin's [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik]] faction and the [[Menshevik Party|Mensheviks]].
