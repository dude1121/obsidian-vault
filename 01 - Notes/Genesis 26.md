[[Genesis 25|Previous]] [[Genesis 27|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. There is a famine in the land. [[Isaac]] goes to Gerar where [[Abimelech]] is still king.
- *2 - 5*. God tells Isaac to settle in [[Philistia]]. God makes the same promise to Isaac as he did to [[Abraham]]: to multiply his offspring.
	- All in all there are a large amount of parallels between Isaac and Abraham
- *7*. Isaac follows the same tradition as Abraham by lying about his wife being his sister. This time though it cannot be excused by his wife being his sister, because Rebekah is Isaac's first cousin.
- *8*. Abimelech sees Isaac fondling ("sporting with", [[King James Version|KJV]]; "displaying affection", [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]]) Rebekah.
- *9*. Abimelech is upset that Isaac has deceived him.
- *12 - 13*. Isaac is rewarded by God for his efforts in Philistia, becoming very wealthy. 
- *16*. Abimelech kicks Isaac out of Philistia.
- *20 - 22*. In verse 15, an aside mentions that the Philistines had filled in the wells Abraham had dug all those years ago. In this verse, Isaac re-digs one of these wells and discovers water, but the locals lay claim to this water. This happens twice. On the third time, no one quarrels with him.
- *23*. Isaac goes to [[Beer-sheba]].
- *24*. God appears to Isaac.
- *26 - 33*. Abimelech and Isaac make a covenant here since Abimelech sees that "the LORD has been with \[him]." 
	- The location is thereby named Beer-sheba despite already being called that back in [[Genesis 21]] by Abraham.
- *34 - 35*. Esau marries Judith and Basemath who "make life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah." 
	- Esau does this when he is 40, meaning this occurs in 2148 AA.
# Thoughts
This entire chapter seems to serve to parallel Isaac to Abraham. Even including the covenant with Abimelech, who must be on death's door at this point.

Isaac even copies Abraham's tactic of calling his wife his sister. But with Isaac, this is an outright lie. Rebekah is his first cousin, once removed, not his sister. If God hates lying, why was Isaac blessed even though he blatantly lied?

Interesting that Beer-sheba is given a second origin with Isaac.
