# Biography
## Early Life
Hitler spent most of his youth in Linz, Austria. He graduated secondary school but that was the extent of his education. He returned to Linz and had dreams of becoming an artist but twice he failed to gain access to the arts academy.
## World War I
In 1913 Hitler relocated to Munich. When World War I broke out he petitioned the King of Bavaria to serve in the army to which the King accepted. He was deployed to the front in October 1914. He was wounded in a battle in October 1916 and gassed 2 years later in Ypres. He was rewarded with the Iron Cross, 2nd Class in December 1914 and the Iron Cross, 1st Class in August 1918.
## NSDAP
Hitler joined the German Workers' Party in 1919. The party was renamed to the National Socialist German Workers' Party in 1920 and in that same year Hitler was placed in charge of the party's propaganda wing. In 1921, Hitler became the leader of the party.

Leading up to November 1923 the party had been growing rapidly, especially in Bavaria. This culminated in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in Munich in November, where Hitler and fellow Nazi general Erich Ludendorff tried to force the leaders of the Bavarian government and the local army commander to proclaim a national revolution. This failed and resulted in Hitler being injured and put on trial for treason and sentenced to prison for 5 years, of which he only served 9 months. During this time he dictated the first volume of [[Mein Kampf]].
