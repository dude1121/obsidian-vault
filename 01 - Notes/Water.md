**Water** is an inorganic [[Compound|compound]] with chemical formula $\ce{H_{2}O}$. 

# Chemical Properties

The bonds of a water [[Molecule|molecule]] are bent, with an $\ce{H-O-H}$ angle of approximately $105\degree$. The [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] and [[Oxygen|oxygen]] atoms are bound by [[Covalent Bond|covalent bonds]], but the electrons are not evenly shared between the two atom types. Oxygen is able to better attract electrons than hydrogen is, which has the effect of inducing a slight [[Voltage|potential difference]] across the molecule. The oxygen atom gains a partial negative [[Charge|charge]] $\ce{2\delta-}$ and the hydrogen atoms gain a partial positive charge $\ce{\delta+}$. Because of this, water is a [[Polar Molecule|polar molecule]].
