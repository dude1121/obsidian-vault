The **mole** $[\pu{ mol}]$ is a unit of measurement in chemistry. It describes the amount of *elementary entities* within a substance. These entities can be [[Atom|atoms]], [[Molecule|molecules]], [[Ion|ions]], or other particles. The number of particles in a mole is defined by [[Avogadro's Number|Avogadro's number]] $N_{0}$ expressed in $[\pu{ mol^{-1}}]$.
