**Standard temperature and pressure** (**STP**) is a standard set of conditions in chemistry at which to describe the properties of various [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]] or [[Compound|compounds]]. In most cases, STP is defined as being a [[Temperature|temperature]] of $273.15\pu{ K}$ ($0\degree\pu{ C}$) and an [[Absolute Pressure|absolute pressure]] of $1\pu{\! bar}$ ($10^5\pu{\! Pa}$).
