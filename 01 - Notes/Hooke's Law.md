**Hooke's law** describes the [[Force|force]] required to extend or compress a spring by some [[Distance|distance]]. This force is proportional to the distance from the spring's equilibrium and the *spring constant*, which varies from spring to spring. 
$$
F_{s}=kx
$$
If we instead want to know the force that the spring exerts on some object attached to the spring (e.g. a block of mass $m$ that is attached to the end of a spring), the force is defined as
$$
F_{s}=-kx
$$
since according to [[Newton's Laws|Newton's third law]] this force must be equal but opposite to the force exerted on the spring.
