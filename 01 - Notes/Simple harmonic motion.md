A particle in **simple harmonic motion** is a model used to represent oscillatory situations. An example of this is [[Spring motion|spring motion]]. From examining a simple spring, we see that,
$$
a=-\frac{k}{m}x
$$
Since [[Acceleration|acceleration]] is the second time [[Derivative|derivative]] of the object's [[Position|position]],
$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\frac{k}{m}x
$$
We can define the term $k/m$ as $\omega^2$. Doing this allows us to solve the [[Differential Equation|differential equation]] easier.
