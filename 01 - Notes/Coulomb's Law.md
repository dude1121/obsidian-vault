**Coulomb’s Law** defines the amount of [[Force|force]] that acts on two [[Point Charge|point charges]].
![[Point Charge]]
It is defined as:
$$ F_e=k_e\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2} $$
where $F$ is the force in [[Newton|newtons]] $[\pu{ N}]$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges, measured in [[Coulomb|coulombs]] $[\pu{ C}]$, $r$ is the distance (or radius) between the charges in [[Metre|metres]] $[\pu{ m}]$, and $k_e$ is _Coulomb’s constant_, defined as
$$ k_e\equiv\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\approx9.0\times10^9\text{ N}\text{m}^2\text{C}^{-2} $$
where $\epsilon_0$ is the [[Permittivity|permittivity]] of free air.

Remember, though, that force is a [[Vector|vector quantity]] and must be treated accordingly. Therefore, we can express Coulomb's Law as a vector equation by,
$$
	\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{e}=k_e\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
$$
where $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ is a [[Unit Vector|unit vector]] directed from $q_1$ to $q_2$. 

The coulomb force (or *electric force*) is [[Conservative Force|conservative]].
