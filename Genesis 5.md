# Summary
- *3*. [[Adam]] became father to a son in his likeness / image.

# Thoughts
I feel like the fact that God "took" [[Enoch]] is a very overlooked detail. Why did he do this? Where did he take him? If he simply died, why is that not written instead?
>[!quote] Genesis 5.24
>Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.

It remains to be seen how this timeline will hold up.
