An **integer** is a number system set that contains the number $0$, all the positive [[Natural Numbers|natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$, and the additive inverses of all the positive natural numbers, i.e., the negative numbers. The set of all integers is often denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$ (named by David Hilbert for the German word "*Zahlen*", meaning "numbers").
