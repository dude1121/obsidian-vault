**Magnetic flux** is a way of [[Units of Measurement|measuring]] how strong a [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]] is at a certain point. It is measured in [[Webers|webers]] $[\text{Wb}]$. It is related to the magnitude of a magnetic field by,
$$
B=\frac{\Phi}{A}
$$
Consider a small portion of the surface area *$dA$* on an arbitrarily shaped surface. If the magnetic field at this portion is $\vec{\mathbf{B}}$, then the magnetic flux through that portion is $\vec{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d\vec{\mathbf{A}}$, and therefore the magnetic flux throughout the entire element is
$$
\Phi=\int \vec{\mathbf{B}}\cdot d \vec{\mathbf{A}}
$$

# Magnetic Circuits

Within a magnetic circuit, magnetic flux behaves similar to how [[current]] behaves in an electrical circuit. Flux is the result of an applied [[Magnetomotive Force|mmf]] to a magnetic circuit. It is given by,
$$
\Phi=\frac{\mathcal{F}}{\mathcal{R}}
$$
This is also called *[[Ohm's Law]] for Magnetic Circuits*. 

$$
v = x^2\hat{x}+3xz^2\hat{y}-2xz\hat{z}
$$
