**Volume** is a measure of some 3D space / shape. Its SI unit of measurement is the cubic [[Metre|metre]] $[\pu{ m^3}]$. If the shape is a container, the volume of that container corresponds to its *capacity*. Generally, the volume of a shape is defined as the [[Area|area]] of its base multiplied by its [[Height|height]].

# Volume integrals
Calculus gives us the tools to calculate the volume of a shape that is defined as some boundary rotated about an axis. In general this formula is,
$$
V=\pi \int_{a}^b\left|f(x)^2-g(x)^2\right|\ dx
$$
where $f$ and $g$ are the plane curve boundaries. If one of the boundaries is the x-axis, this simplifies to,
$$
V=\pi \int_{a}^b \left|f(x)^2\right|\ dx
$$
