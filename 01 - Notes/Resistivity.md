**Resistivity** is a property of a material that measures its ability to resist electrical [[Current|current]]. It is typically denoted by $\rho$ and it is measured in [[Ohm|ohm]]-[[Metre|metres]] $[\Omega \text{/m}]$. It is the proportionality constant for Pouillet's law,
$$
R=\rho \frac{\ell}{A}
$$
Which means that resistivity can be found by,
$$
\rho=R\frac{A}{\ell}
$$
This means that a material's resistivity is directly related to that material's [[Resistance|resistance]].
