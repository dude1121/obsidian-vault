**Elasticity** is a quality of [[Solid|solids]] that related to the behaviour of solid objects when a [[Force|force]] is applied to it that causes its shape to deform in some way. Elasticity is a concept ignored when considering [[Rigid Body|rigid bodies]]. 

When a force is applied across some area on a body, the object experiences [[Stress|stress]].  This stress results in [[Strain|strain]]. The two are directly proportional to one another
$$
\sigma \propto \epsilon
$$
The proportionality constant of this relationship varies depending on the type of stress being experienced. It is called the *elastic modulus* and it comes in three primary varieties: [[Young's Modulus|Young's modulus]], [[Shear Modulus|shear modulus]], and [[Bulk Modulus|bulk modulus]]. Each modulus has its own use case.
- *Young's modulus* measures the resistance of a solid to a change in its length
- *Shear modulus* measures the resistance to motion of the planes within a solid parallel to one another
- *Bulk modulus* measures the resistance of solids or liquids to changes in their volume
