The model of a particle's **motion under constant velocity** allows us to make some assumptions and use various relationships to model the particle's [[Motion|motion]]. If the particle has a constant [[Velocity|velocity]] (i.e. $\dot{\mathbf{v}}=0$) then its final [[Position|position]] is given by
$$
\mathbf{r}_{f}=\mathbf{r}_{i}+\mathbf{v}t
$$
The velocity can be found by,
$$
\mathbf{v}=\frac{\Delta \mathbf{r}}{\Delta t}
$$
If the particle instead has some change in its velocity, the model of a particle [[Motion under Constant Acceleration|under constant acceleration]] must be used.
