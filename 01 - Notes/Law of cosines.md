The **law of cosines**, sometimes known as **cosine law**, relates the sides of any [[Triangle|triangle]] to the [[Cosine|cosine]] of one of its [[Angle|angles]]. For $\Delta ABC$ with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, the law of cosines states,
$$
\begin{align}
c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C \\
a^2=b^2+c^2-2bc\cos A \\
b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\cos B
\end{align}
$$
This law generalizes [[Pythagorean Theorem|Pythagorean theorem]], which only holds for [[Right Triangle|right triangles]]. This can be seen by assuming $\angle C=90\degree$, in which case the first formula reduces to
$$
c^2=a^2+b^2
$$
