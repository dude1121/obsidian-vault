A **Commutator** in its simplest form is composed of a slip ring that is cut in half, with the two segments insulated from one another as well as from the shaft. It is part of dc machines to convert a generated ac voltage to dc or convert an applied dc voltage to ac.

In reality, a commutator is composed of many segments which allow a [[Generator|generator]] to produce a smooth [[DC Electricity|dc]] output as opposed to a [[Voltage Ripple|rippled]] output. The [[Voltage|voltage]] output by the brushes is essentially the sum of all the voltages across each commutator segment between the brushes.

In the case above, the voltage output of this generator would be $70\pu{ \!V}$. If the brushes were shifted, however, the output voltage would decrease, since in this current orientation the brushes are only shorting out segments with a potential of $0\pu{ \!V}$.

This position where the brushes short out segments with zero potential is called the *neutral zone*. When the generator operates at no-load, the neutral zone is directly in the middle between the poles. However, as load is applied, a phenomenon known as *armature reaction* occurs. An increase in load means an increase in armature [[Current|current]]. This increase in armature current means that the [[Magnetomotive Force|mmf]] developed by the armature gets larger. This mmf is in opposition to the established stator field. This causes the stator field to bend around the armature field, which has the effect of shifting the neutral zone.

This shift results in the brushes no longer shorting out segments with zero potential but instead it shorts out segments with some voltage across them. Since the brushes have low [[Resistance|resistance]], this results in a large current through the brushes which is then quickly disconnected as the commutator spins. This can result in sparking, and the larger the shift, the greater the sparking.
