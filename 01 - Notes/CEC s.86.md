# Scope
## 86-000 Scope
> 1) This Section applies to the installation of
> 	a) the insulated conductors and cables and the equipment external to an electric vehicle that connect it to a source of electric current by conductive or inductive means; and
> 	b) equipment and devices related to electric vehicle charging.

# General
## 86-100 Special Terminology
**Electric vehicle** - an automotive-type vehicle for use on public roads that
	a) includes automobiles, buses, trucks, vans, low-speed vehicles, motorcycles, and similar vehicles powered by one or more electric motors that draw current from a fuel cell, photovoltaic array, rechargeable energy storage system (such as a battery or capacitor), or other source of electric current;
	b) includes plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); and
	c) excludes off-road electric vehicles, such as industrial trucks, hoists, lifts, transports, golf carts, airline ground support equipment, tractors, and mobility scooters for persons with disabilities.

**Electric vehicle connector** - a device that, when electrically coupled to a mating device on the electric 
vehicle, establishes means for power transfer and information exchange between an electric vehicle 
and electric vehicle supply equipment.

**Electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE)** - a complete assembly consisting of cables, connectors, 
devices, apparatus, and fittings installed for the purpose of power transfer and information exchange 
between the branch circuit and the electric vehicle.

**Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)** - a type of electric vehicle having an additional energy source 
for motive power.
## 86-102 Voltages in electric vehicle supply equipment installations
> 1) The nominal ac system voltages used to supply equipment covered in this Section shall not exceed  $1000\ \mathrm{V}$.
> 2) The maximum voltage in electric vehicle supply equipment circuits shall not exceed $1060\ \mathrm{Vdc}$.
> 3) The maximum voltage in electric vehicle supply equipment circuits installed in a dwelling unit shall comply with [[CEC s.2#2-110 Circuit voltage-to-ground — Dwelling units|Rule 2-110]].
> 4) Notwithstanding Subrule 2), the maximum voltage in electric vehicle supply equipment circuits shall be permitted to be higher than $1060\ \mathrm{Vdc}$ but not exceeding $1500\ \mathrm{Vdc}$, provided 
> 	a) the installation is serviced only by qualified persons;
> 	b) the part of the installation exceeding $1060\ \mathrm{Vdc}$ is inaccessible to the public; and
> 	c) enclosures in which electric vehicle supply equipment and output circuits exceeding $1060\ \mathrm{Vdc}$ are present are marked with the word “DANGER” followed by the maximum rated electric  vehicle supply equipment circuit voltage of the equipment.
> 5) The installations described in Subrule 4) shall not be required to comply with [[CEC s.36|Section 36]].
## 86-104 Permanently connected and cord-connected equipment
> Rules [[CEC s.86#86-300 Branch Circuits|86-300]] to [[CEC s.86#86-404 Hazardous locations|86-404]] apply to installation of permanently connected and cord-connected electric vehicle supply equipment.
# Equipment
## 86-200 Warning sign
> Permanent, legible signs shall be installed at the point of connection of the electric vehicle supply equipment to the branch circuit wiring, warning against operation of the equipment without sufficient ventilation as recommended by the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
# Control and Protection
## 86-300 Branch Circuits
> 1) Except as permitted by Subrule 2), electric vehicle supply equipment shall be supplied by a separate branch circuit that supplies no other loads except ventilation equipment intended for use with the electric vehicle supply equipment.
> 2) Electric vehicle supply equipment shall be permitted to be supplied by a branch circuit that supplies loads in addition to those described by Subrule 1), provided that an electric vehicle energy management system is installed in accordance with [[CEC s.8#8-106 Use of demand factors|Rule 8-106]] 10) or 11).
> 3) For the purposes of Subrule 2), the calculated demand shall be determined in accordance with [[CEC s.8|Section 8]].
## 86-302 Connected Load
> The total connected load of a branch circuit supplying electric vehicle supply equipment and the ventilation equipment permitted by [[CEC s.86#86-300 Branch Circuits|Rule 86-300]] shall be considered continuous for the purposes of [[CEC s.8#8-104 Maximum circuit loading|Rule 8-104]].
## 86-304 Disconnecting means
> 1) A separate disconnecting means shall be provided for each installation of electric vehicle supply equipment rated at more than $60\ \mathrm{A}$, or more than $150$ volts-to-ground.
> 2) The disconnecting means required in Subrule 1) shall be on the supply side of the point of connection of the electric vehicle supply equipment, and capable of being locked in the open position.
> 3) A single disconnecting means shall be permitted to control two or more electric vehicle supply equipment assemblies, supplied by the same branch circuit, provided that each electric vehicle supply equipment assembly by itself does not exceed a rating of $60\ \mathrm{A}$.
## 86-306 Receptacles for electric vehicle supply equipment
> 1) Each receptacle for the purpose of electric vehicle charging shall be labelled in a conspicuous, legible, and permanent manner, identifying it as an electric vehicle supply equipment receptacle and shall be
> 	a) a single receptacle of CSA configuration 5-20R supplied from a $125\ \mathrm{V}$ branch circuit rated not less than $20\ \mathrm{A}$; or
> 	b) of the appropriate CSA configuration in accordance with [[CEC d.1|Diagram 1]] or [[CEC d.2|2]] when supplied from a branch circuit rated at more than $125\ \mathrm{V}$ or more than $20\ \mathrm{A}$.
> 2) When the receptacle referred to in Subrule 1) a) is installed outdoors and within $2.5\ \mathrm{m}$ of finished grade, it shall be protected with a [[GFCI|ground fault circuit interrupter]] of the Class A type.
## 86-308 Electric vehicle as electric power production source
> 1) Electric vehicle supply equipment and other parts of a system, either on board or off board the vehicle, that are identified for and intended to be interconnected to a vehicle and also serve as an optional standby system or an electric power production source or provide for bi-directional power feed shall be marked accordingly.
> 2) When an electric vehicle is used as described in Subrule 1), the requirements of [[CEC s.84|Section 84]] shall apply.
# Electric vehicle supply equipment locations
## 86-400 Indoor charging sites
> 1) Indoor sites shall be permitted to include, but not be limited to, integral, attached, and detached residential garages, enclosed or underground parking structures, repair and non-repair commercial garages, agricultural buildings, and similar rooms or locations where the electric vehicle connector can couple to the electric vehicle.
