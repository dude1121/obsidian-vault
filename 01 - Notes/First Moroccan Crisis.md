The **First Moroccan Crisis** occurred in 1905. It occurs due to [[Third French Republic|France]] pushing claims into Morocco, which had its independence guaranteed by [[German Empire|Germany]]. 
# Visit of the Kaiser
On March 31, 1905, the German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] visits Tangier, Morocco and met with the Sultan of Morocco, Abdelaziz. The Kaiser says he has visited to support the sovereignty of the Sultan, a direct provocation against the French. This results in the Sultan rejecting a set of French-proposed government reforms, and in a global conference to settle the issue.
# Algeciras Conference
The conference lasts from January 16 - April 7, 1906. Of the 13 nations that attended this conference, only Austria-Hungary backed Germany. France had support from Britain, Russia, Italy, Spain, and the US. The result was that Germany waws forced to sign a face-saving compromise on March 31, 1906.
