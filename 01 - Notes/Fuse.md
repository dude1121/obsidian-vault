A **fuse** is an [[Overcurrent Device|overcurrent device]] that is meant to interrupt [[Current|current]] to protect devices and equipment downstream of the fuse. It does so by melting a wire or strip of conductive material when too much current flows through it.

A fuse must display the following information:
- The full load current (also known as its "rating")
- The rated voltage
- Whether the fuse is a *time delay* or *non-time delay* fuse
- The interrupting capacity
- Whether the fuse is current limiting or non-current limiting

Fuses can either be *time delay* or *non-time delay*. A non-time delay fuse will trip instantaneously (or close to it) when its current limit is reached whereas a time delay fuse will sustain a current of at least $5$ times its rating for $10\ \mathrm{s}$ before tripping. Time delay fuses are used in cases where there may be a large in-rush current at start-up that will decrease (like [[Motor|motors]] or [[Welder|welders]]) whereas non-time delay fuses are more for things that can not handle any amount of overcurrent like electronics.

If a fuse has a low interrupting capacity, it will often be empty except for the filament inside. If, however, the fuse needs a large interrupting capacity, the fuse may be filled with some packing material like sand or silica which will reduce [[Thermal Expansion|thermal expansion]] and allow the fuse to interrupt the overcurrent without breaking or failing closed.
