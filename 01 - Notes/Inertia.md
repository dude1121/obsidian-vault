**Inertia** is the tendency of an object to preserve its current [[Velocity|velocity]], whether it is at rest or in [[Motion|motion]]. It was first described by [[Isaac Newton]] in his [[Newton's Laws|first law]]. Inertia itself is not a measured quantity but rather a concept. It is however related to [[Moment of Inertia|moments of inertia]], which *are* measured quantities.
