The **square root** of a [[number]] $x$ is any number $y$ such that $y^2=x$. Any nonnegative number ($x\geq 0$) has a unique nonnegative root called the *principal root*. Any positive number ($x > 0$) will have both a positive principal square root and a negative root. For example,
$$
\sqrt{ 16 }=\pm 4
$$
The square root of a negative number for any case outside of [[Complex Numbers]] does not exist.

The square root can be denoted with either the radical symbol $\sqrt{ x }$ or as an exponent $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$.
