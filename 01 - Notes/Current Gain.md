**Current gain** is a [[BJT|BJT transistor]] datasheet value that is a ratio of the collector [[Current|current]] with respect to the base current. It is denoted with either $\beta_{DC}$ or $h_{FE}$.
$$
\beta_{DC}=\frac{I_{C}}{I_{B}}
$$
Current gain varies from transistor to transistor but typically ranges from $20 - 200$. As it is a [[Ratio|ratio]], it is [[Units of Measurement|unitless]], but sometimes may be expressed with the units $[\pu{ A}/\pu{ A}]$. 

The dc current gain of a BJT is not a constant value, and will [[Variation|vary directly]] with [[Temperature|temperature]]. 
$$
\beta_{DC}\propto T
$$
