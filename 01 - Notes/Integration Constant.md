The **integration constant** or, sometimes, the **constant of integration** (typically denoted $C$) is an arbitrary [[Constant|constant]] added to [[Integral|indefinite integrals]] that represents any of the constants that may be attached to an [[Antiderivative|antiderivative]] to have a proper result. Since this constant is arbitrary and has no real value when performing an integration, it has the property that any operation done to the constant is equal to the constant itself. That is,
$$
\begin{aligned}
C+C=C&&10C=C&&\frac{C}{2}=C&&C^2=C&&\ln C=C&&e^C=C
\end{aligned}
$$
