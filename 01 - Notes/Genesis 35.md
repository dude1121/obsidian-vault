[[Genesis 34|Previous]] [[Genesis 36|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 4*. [[Jacob]], obeying a command from God, tells his family to get rid of all their idols and earrings in order to purify themselves.
	- God's command did not tell him to collect these things specifically, solely to construct "an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother [[Esau]]" (see [[Genesis 32]]).
- *5*. It is unclear who exactly travels with Jacob back to build the author but *they* venture out. As they travel, a "terror from God" causes none of the surrounding cities to pursue them.
	- What does this mean? Did God do something to the surrounding nations to strike fear into them?
- *6*. Jacob returns to [[Bethel]] (Luz).
	- It is unclear whether Bethel and Luz are the same place with different names (one Israelite, one Canaanite, perhaps) or if they were two places really close to one another (e.g. Kitchener-Waterloo).
- *7*. Jacob builds the altar in Bethel and he names it El-bethel (God of Bethel). 
	- [[New Oxford Annotated Bible|NOAB]] makes an interesting point here. "Deities often had local manifestations (e.g. on ancient inscriptions we find '[[Yahweh]] of [[Samaria]]' or 'Yahweh of Teman'). Jacob \[honours] the local manifestation of El at Bethel by building an altar there and calling the sanctuary 'El of Bethel.'"
- *8*. Deborah, [[Rebekah|Rebekah's]] nurse, dies and is buried under a tree at Bethel. 
- *9 - 10*. When Jacob is returning home through [[Paddan-aram]], God appears to him and changes his name to **Israel**.
	- This is the second time this happens, the first being in [[Genesis 32]]. 
- *11*. In this verse God says he is '[[El Shaddai]]' (אל שדי), translated by most as *God Almighty*. 
	- This title is also used by God in [[Genesis 17]].
- *14 - 15*. Jacob pours out a drink [[Offering (Israelite)|offering]] on a pillar of stone and calls this place Bethel.
	- This is slightly confusing because Jacob just consecrated a place called El-Bethel. In fact, this place has been known as Bethel since Abraham's time (see [[Genesis 12]]), and Jacob re-named it as such in [[Genesis 28]]. 
- *16 - 21*. [[Rachel]] dies in childbirth on the way back from Bethel to [[Ephrath]]. Rachel with her dying breath names the child Ben-oni, meaning 'son of my sorrow' but Jacob instead names the child [[Benjamin (Person)|Benjamin]] meaning 'son of the right hand' or 'son of the south.' Rachel is buried in [[Bethlehem]]. Jacob erects a pillar at the grave site which apparently lasted until the writing of this verse.
- *22*. [[Reuben]] sleeps with [[Bilhah]], Rachel's former maid and Jacob's concubine. This is punished in [[Genesis 49]].
- *23 - 26*. The sons of Jacob are all listed. Verse 26 says these were all born to Jacob in Paddan-aram, but only Benjamin was born here. The rest were born in Haran (see [[Genesis 30]]).
- *27 - 29*. Jacob comes back to [[Hebron]] to be with his father. [[Isaac]] dies at 180 years of age and is buried by Jacob and [[Esau]].
# Thoughts
Once again we see a place named twice, this time, Bethel. We also see a double naming of Jacob to Israel.

The location of Rachel's tomb differs here than in [[1 Samuel]] and [[Jeremiah (Book)|Jeremiah]].

Compare the following translations of verse 18:
>[!quote] Genesis 35.18
>"As her soul was departing..." ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]])
>"And it came to pass in her giving up the ghost" ([[Septuagint|LXX]])
>"And it came to pass as her soule was in departing" ([[King James Version|KJV (1611 Ed.)]])
>"But as she breathed her last..." ([[JPS Tanakh]])
>"as her life was slipping away..." ([[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]])

Most translations describe a soul actually leaving Rachel, whereas the NWT liberally translates this. Funny how they choose to be literal where they want and liberal where they want.
