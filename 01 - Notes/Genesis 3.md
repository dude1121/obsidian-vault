[[Genesis 2|Previous]] [[Genesis 4|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. Mentions just the serpent. No mention of [[Satan]].
	- The canon makes no reference to Satan being the snake until [[Revelation]] [[Revelation 12|12.9]]. Interestingly, the [[Apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Wisdom of Solomon]] 2.24 implies that Satan was 'the snake'. 
- *6*. [[Eve]] sought [[Wisdom|wisdom]], so she ate and shared with [[Adam]].
- *7*. This evidently worked, as the couple now realize their naked state and create clothing.
- *8*. [[God]] was walking in the garden (?)
	- This is possibly figurative
- *12*. Adam instinctively blames Eve for his mistake, as well as God.
- *14*. The snake's crawl is then attributed to God's curse.

>I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head and you will strike his heel.

- *15*. [[Jehovah's Witnesses|JWs]] give large prophetic significance to this verse. It is an interesting verse though, as if this snake is really just a snake, what is the implication here? It is possible there is a larger significance to it, but as to what I am not certain.
	- It is of note that [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]] notes this refers simply to how a snake would now crawl in the dirt, and would be an enemy of man. Man would be inclined to stomp on the head of snakes, whereas they would bite the heel of man. This explanation also makes sense.
- *16*. God doesn't curse Eve with pain in childbirth, but rather adds to it. This also sets up the patriarchal dynamic in [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] with the man "dominating the woman."
- *17*. Adam is punished for listening to his wife and eating the fruit and the result is the ground is cursed. Man will toil to till it and plant fruit.
- *20*. Adam names his wife Eve.
- *22, 23*. Evidently, Adam and Eve had the ability to live forever by eating of the tree of life. Was the tree of life a real mystical tree? Could *anyone* partake of it?
- *24*. [[Cherubim]] are placed at the east of the [[Garden of Eden|garden]].
# Thoughts
Obviously, the idea that the snake is *not* Satan is contrary to what JWs teach. To me, this idea has merit on both sides. If Satan *is* the snake, it can be backed up by Revelation 12.9.
>[!quote] Revelation 12.9
>The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world$~-~$he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.

It stands to reason why they would view Gen. 3.15 as prophetic. However, the snake just being a snake also puts a more literal spin on Gen. 3.15, by having the snake 'bruising' the heel referring simply to snakes biting the heels of [[Israelites]], causing this "emnity." Note, this verse is also known as the [[Protevangelium]]. 

Verses about Eve's curse first mention the gender roles and inequality found in the Bible, especially in the [[Old Testament|OT]]. This inequality is brushed aside as "God's arrangement" by the JWs. This is one of my biggest complaints about the church, and is a bias that is definitely in the Bible but that the JWs seem to ignore.

Another interesting note is that the idea of [[Sin|sin]] is not even mentioned in Genesis 3. This concept is retroactively applied later in the Bible.
