An **arc fault** is a high [[Power#Electromagnetism|power]] discharge of electricity between two or more [[Conductor|conductors]]. This discharge will generate heat which degrades the conductor's insulation and could trigger an electrical fire. Arc faults can range from a few [[Amperes|amps]] to thousands of amps. Common causes include loose wire connections, over heated wires, or pinches wires.

Arc faults are typically prevented by protecting a circuit with an [[AFCI|arc-fault circuit interrupter]].
