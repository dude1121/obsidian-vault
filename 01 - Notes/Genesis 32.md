[[Genesis 31|Previous]] [[Genesis 33|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 2*. [[Jacob]] meets two [[Angel|angels]] on his way from [[Gilead]] and names the place where he meets them "Mahanaim."
- *3 - 5*. Jacob sends messengers to [[Esau]] to "find favour in \[his] sight".
- *6 - 12*. Jacob hears Esau is on his way to meet him with four hundred men. Thinking that Esau is coming to kill him, Jacob splits his company into two groups. He then prays to God to honour his promise to make his offspring numerous and protect him from his brother.
- *13 - 21*. Jacob prepares a large gift for Esau consisting of 220 goats, 220 rams, 30 camels, 40 cows, 10 bulls, and 30 donkeys. Jacob sends these gifts on ahead of himself and instructs his servants to tell Esau that they are gifts to him (Jacob instructs them to call him "Lord Esau") and that Jacob is following behind him.
- *23*. Jacob sends his family across the Jabbok ford.
	- This verse mentions he only has 11 children here. Either daughters don't count (which is definitely plausible) or this indicates a discontinuity by forgetting about [[Dinah]].
- *24*. Jacob is now alone, and a man wrestles with him until daybreak.
	- The inclusion of this man and the wrestling is very sudden. No introduction is given to this man, they just all of a sudden start wrestling all night. This is odd as Genesis typically gives some sort of introduction to each character we meet.
- *25*. The man is only able to beat Jacob by dislocating his hip.
- *26*. Jacob holds on to the man, evidently recognizing he is not human, and demands a blessing.
	- If he *didn't* recognize this "man" was an angel, why did he ask for a blessing?
- *28*. The 'man' gives Jacob a new name: **Israel**. 
	- This name has a meaning something like "the one who strives with God" or "God strives". This likely refers to Jacob's 'wrestling' with men like Esau or Laban, as well as the physical wrestling he just did with the man.
	- It may further have a symbolic meaning for the [[Ancient Israel|nation of Israel]] as a whole, who constantly fought with the surrounding nations, as well as how they constantly disobeyed God and thus 'wrestled' with Him as well.
	- Finally, the name *Israel* replaces the meaning of *Jacob*. Jacob means 'one who supplants' whereas Israel likely originally meant something like '[[El]] rules'. This represents a change in Jacob going forward, no longer does he supplant or take from others but now he will represent the spirit of Israel itself.
- *29*. Jacob asks the man's name but the man refuses to give it, instead asking "why is it that you ask my name?"
	- [[New Oxford Annotated Bible|NOAB]] notes that this may be because in knowing the divine being's name, Jacob would gain power over it. 
- *30*. Jacob names the place this happened "Peniel", meaning 'face of God.'
- *32*. Teleology of why Israelites did not each the meat of the thigh socket of animals, since the man struck Jacob there.
	- This prohibition does not arise anywhere else in the Bible.
# Thoughts
Nothing is ever said about why the angels visit Jacob in 32.1, simply that they did, which I find odd.

However, my questions regarding Jacob wrestling the man are more numerous. Why does he ask this person who, according to the surrounding context, he has no reason to suspect is anything other than just a man, to bless him? Shouldn't God, or at the very least, men of God (i.e. priests, prophets, etc), be the only ones to give out blessings?

Why were they even wrestling in the first place? In 32.25, the [[King James Version|KJV]], [[Septuagint|LXX]], and [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]] all say that the man 'touched' Jacob's hip, but the [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]] says that the man 'struck' Jacob's hip. The [[JPS Tanakh|Tanakh]] is even more violent, saying that the man 'wrenched' his hip. Was this a miraculous 'touch' to display the divine power of the man? If so, it makes Jacob's request for a blessing a bit more logical. 

Finally, who is this man? JWs hold the view that this, along with many other cases, wasn't actually God himself as the text implies but rather an angelic representative. But, like with other examples, that is not what the text says. The Tanakh interprets 32.29 as "you have striven with beings divine and human," which might give credence to the idea that this was an angel and not God. But the Hebrew includes [[Elohim|elohim]] (אלֹהים). Even the name Jacob gives to the place, Peniel, means 'face of God', or, more literally, 'face of El'.

It is hard to say for sure who this man was, but to say it was for sure God or for sure an angel is reductive and it ignores the themes of the text.
