A **photon** is a massless [[Elementary Particle|elementary particle]] that is the force carrier for the [[Electromagnetic Force|electromagnetic force]], as well as being responsible for [[Electromagnetic Radiation|EM radiation]] including [[Light|light]]. Photons are [[Boson|bosons]]. 
# Energy of the photon
The [[Energy|energy]] of a photon depends on its [[Frequency|frequency]] and inversely upon its [[Wavelength|wavelength]]. 
$$
E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$
where $\nu$ is the frequency of the photon, $\lambda$ is its wavelength, $c$ is the [[Speed of Light|speed of light]] and $h$ is the [[Planck Constant|Planck constant]].
