# 1. Peace and Rearmament
## The End of One War, the Start of Another
- WWII began in Europe at dawn on **September 1, 1939**, when German forces crossed into Poland.
- Britain and France declared war on Germany on **September 3, 1939**.
- The war lasted nearly six years and caused over **30 million deaths**.
- The deeper causes of [[World War II|WWII]] trace back through [[World War I|WWI]] and the Versailles system, reflecting a broader German struggle for dominance in Europe.
## The Versailles System and Postwar Settlements
- The post-WWI peace settlements included:
  - **[[Treaty of Versailles]]** (Germany)
  - **[[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]** (Austria)
  - **[[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]** (Bulgaria)
  - **[[Treaty of Trianon]]** (Hungary)
  - **[[Treaty of Sévres]]**, later **Lausanne** (Turkey)
- France played a dominant diplomatic role despite its weakened condition.
- The **[[League of Nations]]** was envisioned as a security mechanism, but its authority was undermined from the start:
  - The United States never joined.
  - Germany and Russia were not members.
  - The League lacked enforcement mechanisms.
- The early 1920s ("period of settlement") saw a flurry of smaller conflicts and diplomatic maneuvering:
  - Greek–Turkish war
  - [[Polish–Soviet war]]
  - Yugoslav–Italian tensions
## Locarno and Diplomatic Optimism
- **1925 Locarno Conference** created agreements among France, Britain, Belgium, Germany, and Italy guaranteeing borders.
- Germany also signed arbitration treaties with Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, and Belgium.
- Despite this, France continued to build bilateral defense alliances:
  - With **Poland** (reaffirmed)
  - With **Czechoslovakia**
- The **[[Kellogg–Briand Pact]] (1928)**, a US–French initiative, renounced aggressive war but had no enforcement mechanism.
## France and the Eastern Alliances
- France signed a defensive alliance with Poland in **1921**, assisting in its war with Russia.
- **Little Entente** formed in 1920 among Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and later Romania.
- France joined the Little Entente post-Locarno, creating a system of Eastern and Southeastern alliances.
- These alliances theoretically formed a wall against German aggression but in practice risked dragging France into any regional conflict.
## Rearmament in Disguise
- The **Treaty of Versailles** limited Germany to:
  - An army of 100,000 men
  - No air force
  - A small navy with no submarines or modern battleships
  - No military installations within 50 km of the Rhine’s east bank
- German evasion of restrictions:
  - The **Reichswehr** was structured as a skeleton army for future expansion.
  - The General Staff reassembled under a disguised administrative office.
  - Covert development of weapons systems, especially tanks and artillery.
  - **Air training** conducted via sport gliding clubs.
  - Collaboration with the **Soviet Union** for mutual training and weapons testing.
## Naval Disarmament and Its Limits
- Disarmament efforts focused primarily on **naval power** due to Anglo-American priorities.
- **Washington Naval Conference (1922)**:
  - Instituted the **5:5:3 capital ship ratio** (US:UK:Japan).
  - France and Italy assigned smaller ratios (1.75).
  - Agreed not to fortify Pacific bases beyond Hawaii (US) or Singapore (UK), benefiting Japan.
- **London Naval Conference (1930)**:
  - Tried to extend tonnage limits to other classes of vessels but failed due to conflicting imperial needs.
  - **Maxim Litvinov** (USSR) proposed total disarmament, rejected as a political ploy.
## Collapse of the Disarmament Movement
- **League of Nations’ disarmament draft (1932)** upheld Versailles restrictions, barring German rearmament.
- This contradiction made meaningful disarmament impossible.
- By **1935**, [[Adolf Hitler]] was in power, and the European mood shifted toward rearmament.
- From that point on, weapons stockpiling and military expansion replaced efforts at peace.
# 2. The European Democracies
## Why the Democracies Failed to Stop Hitler
- The Western democracies underestimated Hitler’s ambitions despite *[[Mein Kampf]]* outlining his agenda.
- Evidence shows they could have stopped him without war had they acted earlier.
- Post-WWI victors were demoralized and distracted by internal crises and disillusionment with the Versailles system.
## The Illusion of French Power
- France regained continental dominance post-1919 due to Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia’s collapse.
- However, this dominance was illusory:
  - France lagged in steel, coal, finance, and population growth.
  - French policy fixated on keeping Germany weak through reparations and enforcement.
- Internal weakness: economic hardship, political instability, and aging society exemplified by the veneration of WWI amputees.
## Political Instability and Strategic Paralysis
- [[Third French Republic|France’s Third Republic]] suffered chronic government turnover and ineffectual leadership.
- Pressing social and economic issues were ignored as factions squabbled.
- Military doctrine suffered from indecision and demographic strain due to a low birthrate and WWI casualties.
## Pétain, Doctrine of Defense, and the Maginot Line
- Marshal Pétain’s WWI success led to defensive orthodoxy: “Le feu tue” ("Fire kills").
- France invested in the **[[Maginot Line]]**, a fortified barrier along the German border.
- The line was intended to economize manpower and redirect German attacks through Belgium.
- France chose not to extend fortifications along the Belgian frontier, relying instead on mobile defense.
## French Military Limitations and Strategic Misjudgments
- France underfunded and neglected tank and mechanized unit development.
- Strategic doctrine remained wedded to static trench warfare, dismissing mobility innovations.
- Visionaries like **[[Charles de Gaulle]]** proposed mobile, professional armies but were ignored.
- Result: French tanks excelled in infantry support but lacked speed, maneuverability, and coordination.
## Airpower Misconceptions and Naval Strength
- Aircraft seen primarily as support tools; long-range strategic bombing was underdeveloped.
- France built a strong navy, particularly in the Mediterranean, but it would be irrelevant in a continental war.
## Britain’s Hesitation and the Illusion of Security
- Britain reverted to isolationist policies post-WWI, relying on naval supremacy.
- Distrust lingered between Britain and France despite the wartime alliance.
- Britain favoured the League of Nations and resisted permanent ties to France.
- Social unrest, imperial decline, and economic weakness also plagued Britain.
## Appeasement and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement
- Britain sought to moderate Versailles and improve relations with Germany.
- The **1935 [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]]**:
  - Allowed Germany 35% of British naval strength and parity in submarines.
  - Effectively undermined Versailles and emboldened Hitler.
## The Ten-Year Rule and Misguided Air Doctrine
- British defense planning based on the “ten-year rule”: no major war expected.
- Strategic bombing theorists like Giulio Douhet influenced RAF priorities:
  - Emphasis on bombers, minimal fighter development.
  - The slogan: “The bomber will always get through.”
- Britain began ramping up fighter production only by 1937.
## Weakness Rooted in Willpower
- The failures of Britain and France were rooted not only in war damage but in a lack of national will.
- Civilian governments and public opinion avoided military spending and innovation.
- In contrast, the dictatorships faced no such limitations.
# 3. The Revisionist States
## Italy’s Path to Fascism and Expansionism
- Italy joined the Allies in 1915, lured by promises of territorial gains.
- Postwar settlements left Italy feeling cheated; internal unrest followed.
- [[Benito Mussolini]] founded the [[Fascism|Fascist movement]] in 1919; [[March on Rome|marched on Rome]] in 1922.
- Once in power, Mussolini dismantled democratic institutions and built a one-party state.
- Early foreign policy focused on Mediterranean influence, including Corfu (1923) and treaties with Austria, Hungary, and Albania.
## The Ethiopian War and League Collapse
- Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, avenging its 1896 defeat at Adowa.
- The League of Nations imposed weak sanctions; Britain and France feared alienating Italy.
- Italy used modern weapons and poison gas; declared victory in 1936.
- The episode discredited the League and pushed Italy toward Germany.
## Spanish Civil War and Closer Axis Ties
- [[Spanish Civil War|Civil war erupted in Spain]] in 1936 between Republicans and Franco’s Nationalists.
- Italy sent 50,000 troops and significant aid; Germany also intervened.
- The war served as a proving ground for Axis tactics (e.g. Guernica bombing).
- Italy joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1937 and withdrew from the League.
## Germany from Weimar to Nazism
- The [[Weimar Republic]] faced economic crisis, political violence, and humiliation under Versailles.
- Hitler’s [[Beer Hall Putsch]] failed in 1923; he used his trial and prison time to elevate his profile.
- Stabilization occurred from 1924–1929, but the Depression reversed it.
- Nazi support surged in 1930; Hitler became Chancellor in 1933.
- He rapidly consolidated power: outlawed opposition, purged the SA (1934), and merged the offices of President and Chancellor.
## German Rearmament and the Road to War
- Hitler introduced conscription (1935) and re-militarized the Rhineland (1936).
- British appeasement included the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (1935).
- The military hierarchy was purged in 1938 (Blomberg–Fritsch affair); Hitler centralized power.
- [[Anschluss|Germany annexed Austria]] in 1938 without resistance.
## Japan as the Asian Revisionist Power
- Japan's rise began with victories over China (1894–95) and Russia (1904–05).
- Versailles sidelined Japan; resentment grew over racial exclusion and naval limits.
- The 1931 [[Mukden Incident]] led to occupation of Manchuria; Japan left the League in 1933.
- Assassinations and military dominance escalated through the 1930s.
- Full-scale war with China began in 1937 after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].
- [[Rape of Nanking|Atrocities in Nanking]] and attacks on foreign vessels (e.g. USS *Panay*) drew global attention but little response.
# 4. The Unknown Quantities
## Russia: Power Unknown, Motives Distrusted
- Hitler underestimated both Russia and the U.S., focusing instead on the perceived weakness of Britain and France.
- Russia loomed large on the map but was a mystery in strength and intentions, worsened by distrust on all sides.
- Tsarist Russia had heavily aided the Allies in WWI, but the **[[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Revolution]]** and **[[Russian Civil War|civil war (1917–1920)]]** severed those ties.
- Western intervention in the civil war further embittered Soviet views of the West.
- By 1920, the **[[Bolshevik Party|Bolsheviks]]** were firmly in control, the West distrusted them, and vice versa.
## Soviet Power Consolidation and Pariah Diplomacy
- Lenin’s regime became a dictatorship “of the proletariat”—rhetorically distinct but functionally authoritarian.
- After Lenin’s death in **1924**, **Stalin outmanoeuvred Trotsky**, consolidating control. Trotsky was later assassinated in **1940**.
- **[[Treaty of Rapallo]] (1922)** began Soviet-German military cooperation.
- Diplomatic recognition came slowly: Britain (1924), most of Europe, **U.S. not until 1933**.
- In the 1930s, the USSR signed multiple **nonaggression pacts** and joined the **League of Nations (1934)**.
- Despite public disarmament rhetoric, the USSR remained the **chief ideological enemy** in Western eyes.
## Stalin’s Purges and International Doubts
- In **1935**, USSR signed a mutual-defense pact with France and Czechoslovakia.
- The **Third International (1936)** supported democracy against fascism, and the USSR backed Spanish Republicans.
- **[[Great Purges]] (1936–1938)** targeted rivals under charges of “Trotskyism,” culminating in the execution of Marshal Tukhachevsky.
- These purges decimated military leadership and politicized the army, damaging Soviet credibility abroad.
- By 1939, the true strength and intentions of Russia remained unclear, especially to Hitler.
## The United States: Rich, Remote, and Unarmed
- The U.S. was geographically distant, with minimal armed forces and no conscription.
- 1936 Army size: only 110,000 men, lacking basic modern equipment.
- Belief in rapid mobilization proved illusory; the U.S. was practically unprepared for war.
## Legacy of WWI and Retreat from Global Leadership
- U.S. entered WWI late (1917) and suffered relatively few casualties.
- Postwar, Americans believed they had won the war but were tricked into it.
- The U.S. **rejected Versailles**, **refused to join the League**, and passed its own peace resolution in 1921.
## Isolationism and Antiwar Sentiment in the 1920s–30s
- Popular memory of WWI soured; war was seen as a racket driven by elites.
- Domestic focus dominated: **prohibition**, **tariffs**, **labour unrest**, and **anti-immigrant laws**.
- Reparations and war debt issues fuelled resentment; the **Dawes Plan** became a circular lending scheme that collapsed in the Depression.
## U.S. Foreign Policy in the 1930s: Stay Out
- Japan’s aggression in **Manchuria and China** provoked U.S. protests but no real action.
- The U.S. passed successive **Neutrality Acts** (1935, 1936, 1937), banning arms exports and loans to belligerents, enforcing “**cash-and-carry**” rules.
- The overwhelming goal: **avoid being dragged into another European war**.
- Ironically, if Hitler believed the U.S. would stay out of his wars, **most Americans agreed with him**.
# 5. The Prewar Series of Crises
## Hitler’s Strategic Position in 1938
- By early 1938, Hitler assessed that both domestic and foreign resistance to German expansion was weak.
- The successful **remilitarization of the Rhineland** encouraged further territorial moves.
## Anschluss with Austria
- Hitler's first major step was the **Anschluss (March 1938)**.
- Austria, weakened politically and economically, faced internal agitation from pro-Nazi elements.
- Chancellor Schuschnigg attempted a plebiscite; Hitler responded with an ultimatum and invasion on March 12.
- A rigged vote followed, showing 99.75% support for union with Germany.
- Britain and France issued weak protests, continuing the policy of **appeasement**.
## Czechoslovakia and the Sudeten Crisis
- With Austria absorbed, **Czechoslovakia** became Hitler’s next target.
- Czechoslovakia was industrially strong, democratic, and allied to France, Romania, and Yugoslavia.
- The German-speaking **Sudeten minority**, led by Konrad Henlein, agitated for autonomy under Hitler’s direction.
## The May Crisis and Henlein’s Demands
- In May 1938, Henlein presented the **Carlsbad Demands**, calling for full autonomy.
- Czechoslovakia mobilized; Britain and France pressured Prague to concede.
- Hitler temporarily backed down, but tensions remained high through the summer.
## Chamberlain’s Intervention
- British PM **Neville Chamberlain** took personal control of diplomacy, seeking direct talks with Hitler.
- Despite Czech resistance, Chamberlain aimed to negotiate away the crisis.
## Munich Agreement (September 1938)
- Hitler raised new demands at **Bad Godesberg**, nearly triggering war.
- The **Munich Conference (Sept 29–30)**, attended by Germany, Italy, Britain, and France—but not Czechoslovakia—ceded the **Sudetenland** to Germany.
- **Poland and Hungary** also seized Czech territory.
- Chamberlain returned claiming “peace in our time.”
## Aftermath of Munich
- **Hitler was dissatisfied**, having been denied a short victorious war.
- In **March 1939**, Germany occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia, violating the Munich terms.
- It became clear Hitler’s aims exceeded reunification of Germans.
## Crisis over Poland
- Hitler next demanded changes to the **Polish Corridor** and annexed **Memel**.
- **Poland refused** concessions.
- Britain and France issued guarantees to Poland in response to German aggression.
## The Nazi-Soviet Pact
- Britain and France sought Soviet alliance but moved slowly.
- On **August 23, 1939**, Germany and the USSR signed the **[[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]**, including a secret protocol to divide Poland.
## Outbreak of War
- Germany invaded Poland on **September 1, 1939**.
- Britain and France declared war on Germany on **September 3** after issuing ignored ultimatums.
# 6. Blitzkrieg in Poland
## German Strategic Planning
- Hitler ordered invasion planning immediately after occupying Czechoslovakia.
- Poland was nearly surrounded: Germany to the west, East Prussia to the north, and German-held Czechoslovakia to the south.
- Two main thrusts were planned:
  - **Army Group North** (von Bock) from East Prussia
  - **Army Group South** (von Rundstedt) from Silesia and Slovakia
## German Forces and Deployment
- Army Group North: 630,000 men, 500 bombers, 180 Stukas, 120 fighters, 1 armored corps
- Army Group South: 886,000 men, 310 bombers, 160 Stukas, 120 fighters, 1 armored corps
- Navy targeted Polish ports (e.g. **Gdynia**, **Hel**)
- Luftwaffe held 250 Ju52s for paratroop use
## Polish Strategic Position
- Commander: Marshal **Edward Smigly-Rydz**
- Poland could field up to 1,000,000 men, though only 800,000 reached units in time
- Six armies deployed in a **linear frontier defense**
  - Overextended and exposed to rapid encirclement
- Equipment:
  - 935 aircraft (mostly obsolete)
  - Cavalry units still prominent
  - Few tanks, poor motorization, minimal fortifications
## Opening of the Campaign
- **September 1, 1939**: Germany launched coordinated air-ground assault
- Myth of air force destruction on day one is false; Polish Air Force was overwhelmed over several days
- German armor advanced up to 15 miles on day one
## German Operational Phases
- Phase 1: Penetrate frontier defenses — succeeded immediately
- Phase 2: Envelop and destroy Polish forces
  - Luftwaffe attacks on command centers and roads paralyzed Polish response
  - Communications collapsed within days
- **September 3**: Britain and France declared war, but made no military moves
## Drive on Warsaw and Polish Collapse
- **September 9**: German forces surrounded Warsaw
- Polish Poznan Army attempted breakout:
  - **September 14**: Failed; 52,000 surrendered by **September 17**
- Eastern Polish armies were encircled and broken by **September 19**
- Warsaw resisted until **September 27**
## Final Resistance and Soviet Invasion
- Coastal garrisons like **Hel Peninsula** held out into October
- Last organized Polish unit surrendered **October 6**
- **September 17**: Soviet Union invaded from the east
  - In accordance with the **Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact**
  - USSR captured 200,000 Polish troops fleeing German advance
  - Germans and Soviets avoided contact to prevent confrontation
## Western Inaction
- Britain and France failed to launch serious attacks despite war declarations
  - French Army had 85 divisions, 3,200 tanks, 1,600 heavy guns
  - Faced only 8 German divisions in the west
- RAF possessed nearly 800 bombers but followed **no-strike orders**
  - Dropped propaganda leaflets instead of bombs
## Strategic Consequences
- German–Soviet partition of Poland completed without Allied interference
- The campaign demonstrated effectiveness of **[[Blitzkrieg]]**
- Western failure to act decisively in 1939 was a major missed opportunity
# 7. Northern Adventures
## The Phoney War and Strategic Hesitations
- After Poland’s fall, Hitler aimed to attack France, but generals delayed for winter refitting.
- Britain and France did little; the **British Expeditionary Force** was too small to influence French planning.
  - Britain adopted the uninspiring slogan: “Business as usual.”
- This lull became known as the **Phoney War**.
## Soviet Expansion in the Baltics
- USSR pushed into **Lithuania**, **Latvia**, and **Estonia** under "mutual defense" treaties.
  - Red Army moved in immediately, converting them into Soviet satellites.
- Stalin also made territorial demands on **Finland**:
  - Wanted 50 miles of the **Karelian Isthmus**, key islands, and a lease on **Hanko**.
  - **November 26, 1939**: Finland rejected the demands and mobilized.
## The Winter War Begins
- **November 30, 1939**: Soviets launched air attacks on **Helsinki** and invaded Finland.
- Finland's defense:
  - ~300,000 regulars, fortified **Mannerheim Line** on the Isthmus.
  - ~100,000 Civic Guard reservists and women’s auxiliary each.
  - Small air force and navy, minimal armor, highly mobile light infantry.
- Soviet force: ~1 million men, 30 divisions, 6 tank brigades, 800 aircraft.
## Battles on the Karelian Isthmus
- Soviets launched massive, clumsy frontal assaults.
  - High casualties due to poor tactics and stiff Finnish resistance.
  - Amphibious landings failed; city bombings hardened Finnish resolve.
- By mid-December, Soviets stalled; Finns briefly counterattacked but suffered heavy losses.
## Northern Finland: Tactical Finnish Successes
- Soviets advanced in 5 corps-level drives.
- **Petsamo** taken by amphibious assault, but central and eastern drives failed.
  - Finnish ski troops ambushed supply lines, targeting kitchens and shelter equipment.
  - In deep snow and sub-zero temps, Soviets suffered:
    - **Tolvajarvi**, **Suomussalmi**, and **Lake Ladoga**: Soviet units annihilated or forced to retreat.
    - ~28,000 Soviet casualties; Finnish losses: ~900 dead, ~1,800 wounded.
## Soviet Reforms and Final Assault
- In **February 1940**, Soviets concentrated 24 divisions on the Karelian Isthmus.
  - Launched intense artillery-supported assaults on **February 1**.
  - **February 13**: Finnish line broke; by **March 1** Finns began peace talks.
- **March 12**: War ended; USSR gained initial demands.
## Consequences and Misconceptions
- World misjudged Soviet capacity; assumed they were too weak for modern warfare.
  - USSR quietly restructured command and doctrine post-war.
- Allies had considered intervention but were blocked by **Norwegian and Swedish neutrality**.
  - Key interest: **Swedish iron ore** and strategic ports like **Narvik**.
## The Altmark Incident and Naval Escalation
- **February 1940**: British violated Norwegian neutrality to rescue POWs from **Altmark**, a German ship.
  - Triggered Hitler’s decision to occupy Scandinavia.
## German Invasion of Denmark and Norway
- **April 9, 1940**: Germany launched simultaneous attacks:
  - Denmark overrun with minimal resistance.
  - Norway: German troops landed at **Oslo**, **Bergen**, **Trondheim**, **Stavanger**, and **Narvik**.
- Oslo delayed by coastal fort fire; **Blücher** sunk.
  - Troops landed by air at **Fornebu**, seized the capital.
## Naval Clashes and Allied Countermoves
- British destroyer **Glowworm** rammed German cruiser **Hipper**.
- British submarines sank German cruisers near Denmark and **Bergen**.
- At **Narvik**, Royal Navy destroyed supply ship and German destroyers in two raids.
## Allied Landings and Withdrawal
- Allies landed:
  - ~30,000 at **Andalsnes** and **Namsos** to isolate Trondheim
  - ~15,000 at **Narvik**
- In central/southern Norway, **Luftwaffe superiority** forced Allied retreat:
  - **May 1–3**: Evacuations from Andalsnes and Namsos.
  - **Early June**: Final withdrawal from Narvik area as France crisis unfolded.
## Strategic Outcomes
- Norway campaign revealed Allied naval weaknesses vs air power.
- **May 10, 1940**: Chamberlain resigned, replaced by **Winston Churchill**.
- Germany gained:
  - Access to Swedish ore
  - Naval/air bases for raiders and Arctic convoys
- But paid a cost:
  - German Navy severely weakened.
  - Long-term occupation tied down over 250,000 German troops.
  - Opened another front to garrison indefinitely.
# 8. The Fall of France
## German Planning and Allied Assumptions
- Germany’s attack on France (**Fall Gelb**) initially mirrored the 1914 plan through Belgium.
- Allies deployed strongest forces north, expecting a repeat.
- In **February 1940**, **von Manstein** proposed a radical shift:
  - Main thrust through the **Ardennes**, assumed impassable to armor.
  - French “Dyle Plan” called for rapid deployment into Belgium.
## The German Offensive Begins
- **May 10, 1940**: Germany invaded **Belgium**, **Netherlands**, **Luxembourg**, and **France**.
  - Airborne troops captured bridges and airfields.
  - **Fort Eben-Emael** was neutralized by glider assault.
- Allies advanced into Belgium—into the trap.
## Breakthrough in the Ardennes
- **Panzer Group Kleist** advanced through the Ardennes toward the **Meuse River**.
  - Light French resistance failed to anticipate the pace of movement.
- **May 13**: Germans crossed the Meuse at **Sedan**.
  - Massive Luftwaffe strikes disoriented French defenses.
- French command hesitated; no effective counterattacks followed.
## The Sickle Cut and the Encirclement
- German armor advanced rapidly toward the Channel.
  - Executed the **“Sickle Cut”**, encircling Allied northern forces.
- French high command failed to register the scale of the breakthrough.
- British and French armies in Belgium were trapped.
## Allied Collapse in the North
- Delaying actions fought, but the trap closed.
- **May 20**: German forces reached **Abbeville**, cutting off northern armies.
- French counterattacks at **Arras** and **Amiens** failed.
- German **halt order** gave Allies time to prepare evacuation.
## Dunkirk Evacuation
- **Operation Dynamo**: evacuation from **Dunkirk** (May 26–June 4).
  - ~338,000 troops rescued; most heavy equipment abandoned.
  - ~35,000 Allied soldiers captured.
- Psychological boost for Britain despite strategic defeat.
## Fall of Paris and Southern Collapse
- German advance resumed after Dunkirk.
- **June 10**: Italy declared war on France.
- **June 14**: Germans entered **Paris**.
- Government fled; **Pétain** replaced Reynaud and requested armistice.
## Armistice and Occupation
- **June 22**: Armistice signed at **Compiègne**.
  - North and west France occupied by Germany.
  - South became **[[Vichy France]]** under Pétain.
  - French military disbanded; navy remained under French control.
## Strategic Consequences
- France collapsed in six weeks despite numerical strength.
- Britain stood alone; Hitler’s prestige surged.
- Consequences:
  - Germany seized French arms and resources.
  - The **Free French** resistance began in exile.
# 9. The Battle of Britain
## After the Fall of France
- By summer 1940, **Hitler controlled continental Europe**, but Britain remained defiant.
- Britain was isolated; the **English Channel** was the last defensive barrier.
- British military situation:
  - Army recovering from **Dunkirk**.
  - Little armor or heavy equipment.
  - Home Guard formed as last line of defense.
  - **Churchill** pledged total resistance.
## Operation Sea Lion and German Planning
- Hitler ordered invasion plans under **Operation Sea Lion**.
  - Germany had no amphibious experience.
  - Barges assembled for cross-Channel transport.
- Success required **air superiority**:
  - Luftwaffe tasked with defeating the RAF.
  - German Navy unable to contest British naval supremacy under enemy air control.
## Forces and Capabilities
- **Luftwaffe**:
  - Commanded by **Goering**, morale high.
  - Aircraft:
    - **Bf 109e**: strong fighter but limited range.
    - **Heinkel**, **Dornier** bombers: under-defended.
    - **Me 110**: poor performance.
- **RAF**:
  - Retained 59 squadrons by halting reinforcements to France.
  - Home advantage: pilots shot down could return to fight.
## Radar and Early Warning
- British radar system provided early detection of incoming raids.
  - Crude but effective.
  - Germans underestimated its strategic impact.
## Channel Battle (July–August 1940)
- Luftwaffe targeted convoys and ports.
  - RAF suffered losses; convoys vulnerable.
  - **Dowding** avoided full engagement to preserve strength.
## Adlerangriff and Eagle Day
- Full offensive began with **Adlerangriff** ("Eagle Attack") on **August 13**.
  - Radar attacks largely ineffective.
  - **August 15** ("Black Thursday"): Luftwaffe lost ~75 aircraft.
- German focus on airfields intensified.
  - RAF pressure peaked by late August.
  - Several key airfields heavily damaged.
## Shift to London and the Blitz
- **September 7**: Bombing focus shifted to **London**.
  - ~1,000 bombers struck the capital.
  - Civilian casualties high.
- Strategic effects:
  - RAF received critical reprieve.
  - British morale held firm; public resilience increased.
## Strategic and Psychological Outcomes
- RAF production increased under **Beaverbrook**.
  - Pilot shortage remained severe.
- German bombing of cities backfired:
  - Allowed RAF to recover.
  - Germans unable to sustain daylight dominance.
- International perception:
  - British resistance inspired American sympathy.
  - Propaganda victories for Churchill’s government.
## End of the Battle
- **Coventry raid (November)** caused heavy damage but failed to break morale.
- No formal end, but daylight raids declined.
- **October 1940**: Hitler postponed invasion and turned focus eastward.
- Losses:
  - RAF: ~790 fighters.
  - Luftwaffe: ~1,400 aircraft.
- **Churchill**: “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.”
