A **magnetic field** is a [[Field Force|field force]] generated by two magnetic poles. It is typically represented with the symbol $\vec{\mathbf{B}}$. We can trace the direction of a magnetic field with *magnetic field lines*, similar to how we can use *electric field lines* to visualize [[Electric Field|electric fields]]. Unlike an electric field, however, we can actually use physical means to see this field working. If we place a bar magnet in some iron filings, the pattern of the magnetic field emerges.

# Behaviour

We can define a magnetic field $\vec{\mathbf{B}}$ at some point in space in terms of the magnetic force $\vec{F_{B}}$ that the field exerts on a [[Charge|charged]] [[Particle|particle]] moving through that field with a given [[Velocity|velocity]] $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$, known as the *test object*.

From experimentation, we know that a when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field and its velocity [[Vector|vector]] makes any angle with the field vector (i.e. $\theta\neq 0$), the magnetic force acts in a direction perpendicular to both $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$ and $\vec{\mathbf{B}}$. I.e., $\vec{F_{B}}$ is perpendicular to the plane formed by $\vec{\mathbf{v}}$ and $\vec{\mathbf{B}}$.  The magnitude of this force is proportional to both the charge of the particle and its speed, as well as to $\sin\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle the velocity vector makes with the magnetic field.

Algebraically we can summarize these findings as,
$$
\vec{F_{B}}=q \vec{\mathbf{v}}\times\vec{\mathbf{B}}
$$
This first relationship is part of the [[Lorentz Force Law]].
$$
F_{B}=|q|vB\sin\theta
$$
This means that the magnitude of the magnetic force is $0\text{N}$ when the particle's velocity is parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field vector ($\theta=0\degree$ or $\theta=180\degree$) and maximum when the particle's velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field.

From this we see there are some key differences between magnetic and electric fields:
- The force vector in an electric field is along the direction of the field, but a magnetic force vector is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction.
- An electric field acts on a charged particle even if it is not moving, whereas a magnetic force acts only when the charged particle is in motion.
- The electric force does [[Work|work]] in displacing a charged particle, but the magnetic force associated with a steady magnetic field does no work when a particle is displaced due to the fact that the force is perpendicular to the displacement.
From our equation that determines the magnitude of the magnetic force vector, we can determine the units of a magnetic field.
$$
[\vec{\mathbf{B}}]=\left[\frac{\text{N}}{\text{C}\cdot \text{m/s}}\right]
$$
We can also measure a magnetic field in *[[Tesla|teslas]]* named after Nikola Tesla. 
$$
1\text{T}=1\frac{\text{N}}{\text{C}\cdot \text{m/s}}
$$
But since a [[coulomb]] per second is also an [[Amperes|ampere]],
$$
1\text{T}=1\frac{\text{N}}{\text{A}\cdot \text{m}}
$$
Any conductor that carries electric current will generate a magnetic field around it. There are two *right hand rules* that apply to magnetic fields.
1. For any conductor, point your thumb in the direction of conventional current flow. The direction your fingers curl is the direction of the magnetic field generated around the conductor.
2. For a given coil of wire with a current through it, curl your fingers in the direction of conventional current flow. Your thumb will point in the direction of magnetic flux.
A coil of wire with a current running through it produces a magnetic field that flows through the centre of the coil. The flux distribution of the coil is similar to that of a permanent magnet. However, a coil with no magnetic material in the centre will produce a weak magnetic field since the magnetic field can be determined by the density of flux lines.
$$
B=\frac{\Phi}{A}
$$
where $\Phi$ is the [[Magnetic Flux|magnetic flux]], measured in [[Webers|webers]] $[\text{Wb}]$ (named after German physicist *Wilhelm Eduard Weber*), and $A$ is a given cross-sectional area $[\text{m}^2]$.

If a nonmagnetic material such as glass or copper is placed in a magnetic field, an almost unnoticeable change occurs in the flux distribution. However if the material is magnetic, then the flux lines will pass through the magnetic material rather than the surrounding air since flux lines are able to pass through magnetic materials with greater ease.

Since magnetic flux flows more easily through magnetic materials like iron, steel, or cobalt, we can increase the strength of the generated magnetic field by placing a magnetic material in the core of a coil of wire. This is the general principle of an *electromagnet* or [[Solenoid]].

The flux density of an electromagnet is directly proportional to the number of turns of, and current through, the coil. The product of the two is called the [[Magnetomotive Force|magnetomotive force]]. 
$$
\mathcal{F}=NI
$$
where $N$ is the number of turns (typically unitless but sometimes denoted with a $[\text{t}]$ for *turns*), and $I$ is the current $[\text{A}]$ through the coil. The unit of the magnetomotive force is [[Ampere-turns|ampere-turns]] $[\text{At}]$.

Magnetomotive force is able to generate magnetic flux in a given material. How well that material permits the creation of said flux lines is called that material's [[Permeability|permeability]].

# Inducing a Current

According to [[Faraday's Law]], a changing magnetic field can induce an electrical current in a conductor.
$$
\mathcal{E}=N\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
$$
From this we see that if the magnetic field is constant (i.e. $\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}=0$) there is no induced emf. The magnetic field must therefore be changing for there to be an induced voltage. This can occur in various ways:
- The magnitude of $\vec{\mathbf{B}}$ may vary with time.
- The area enclosed by the coil may change with time.
- The angle $\theta$ between $\vec{\mathbf{B}}$ and the normal to the loop can vary with time.
- Any combination of the above.
