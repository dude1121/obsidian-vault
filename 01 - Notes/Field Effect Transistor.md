A **field effect transistor**, otherwise known as a **FET**, is a type of [[Transistor|transistor]] that uses an [[Electric Field|electric field]] to control [[Current|current]] through a [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]]. There are two types of FETs: [[Junction Field Effect Transistor|JFETs]] (junction field effect transistor) and [[Metal Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor|MOSFETs]] (metal oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor). All FETs have three terminals: *gate*, *source*, and *drain*. These devices control current flow by the application of a voltage to the gate terminal which in turn alters the [[Conductivity|conductivity]] between the drain and the source.

Unlike [[Bipolar junction transistor|BJTs]] which are *bipolar* transistors, FETs are *unipolar*, meaning they only use either [[Electron|electrons]] or [[Hole Current|holes]] as charge carriers, never both. In FETs, an *n* type device uses electrons as charge carriers whereas a *p* type device will use holes as charge carriers.
