A **project scope** is a document that gives a broad overview of an entire [[Project|project]]. This is ideally one of the first documents created in the *planning* phase of the project. It should include:
- project statement
- [[Acceptance Criteria|acceptance criteria]]
- validation/testing plan
- project [[Deliverable|deliverables]]
- project [[Project Exclusion|exclusions]]
- project [[Constraint|constraints]]
- project coordination

The scope should be specific and contain as much detail as possible. Future changes to the scope are possible, but should be avoided. 

# Scope statement

The project scope statement should include at least a product scope description, product user acceptance criteria, and detailed information on all project deliverables. It should also document other scope-related information such as project boundaries, constraints, and assumptions. It should further reference supporting documents such as product specifications. 

# Scope creep

Scope creep is a term used for seemingly small, incremental changes to the project's initial scope statement. As a project is ongoing, the requirements tend to increase. A single deliverable becomes five, products with three features become products with ten, etc. This is commonly caused by key [[Stakeholder|stakeholders]] changing requirements or sometimes from internal miscommunication and disagreements. Scope creep is not necessarily a bad thing and is a reality the PM needs to accept. Scope creep is to be managed, not necessarily avoided outright.
