An **alkali metal** is an element in the first group of the [[Periodic Table|periodic table]], excluding [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]]. The alkali metals include:
- [[Lithium]] $\ce{_{3}Li}$
- [[Sodium]] $\ce{_{11}Na}$
- [[Potassium]] $\ce{_{19}K}$
- [[Rubidium]] $\ce{_{37}Rb}$
- [[Cesium]] $\ce{_{55}Cs}$
- [[Francium]] $\ce{_{87}Fr}$
Despite being in the first group in the periodic table, [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] is not an alkali metal. This is because the electron in hydrogen's [[Valence Shell|valence shell]] is too close to the [[Nucleus|nucleus]] and bound too tightly to behave as an alkali metal.

Alkali metals are all shiny, soft, highly [[Reactivity|reactive]] metals at [[Standard Temperature and Pressure|standard temperature and pressure]]. Alkali metals most commonly form [[Ion|cations]] with [[Charge|charge]] $+1$. They are found naturally only in [[Ionic Compound|salts]] and never by themselves as free [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]]. Cesium is the most reactive metal, but all will react with air and violently react with [[Water|water]].

All alkali metals have one [[Valence Shell|valence electron]], which makes them very reactive with the [[Halogen|halogens]].

As with all groups, elements further down in the group have increasing densities. This is because atomic mass generally increases more rapidly than atomic size.

The smooth decrease in [[Melting Point|melting point]] and [[Boiling Point|boiling point]] is atypical; other groups have much more complicated behaviour. 

Due to their low first ionization energies, alkali metals are incredibly reactive with nonmetals, forming [[Ionic Compound|ionic]] [[Solid|solids]]. The relative [[Chemical Reaction#Oxidation-Reduction Reactions|reducing]] powers of the alkali metals can be predicted by looking at the ionization energies. Since it is much easier to remove an electron from cesium than lithium, cesium should be the better reducing agent.
$$
\ce{Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li}
$$
This holds for solid alkali metals and nonmetals, but in aqueous solution this is very different. 
$$
\ce{2M(s) + 2H_{2}O(l) -> H_{2}(g) + 2M+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) + energy}
$$
The order of reducing abilities for this reaction for the first three members is
$$
\ce{Li > K > Na}
$$
The reversal occurs because the formation of $\ce{M+}$ ions in aqueous solution is strongly influenced by the [[Hydration|hydration]] of these ions by [[Polar Molecule|polar]] [[Water|water]] molecules. The [[Hydration Energy|hydration energy]] for $\ce{Li+, Na+}$, and $\ce{K+}$ ions are all negative, indicating that they are [[Exothermic Process|exothermic]]. However, nearly twice as much energy is released by the hydration of the $\ce{Li+}$ ion than the $\ce{K+}$ ion. Since the lithium ion is much smaller than the potassium ion, it has a greater [[Charge Density|charge density]], making polar water molecules more strongly attracted to the $\ce{Li+}$ ion. Because it is so strongly hydrated, its formation occurs more readily than the formation of the $\ce{K+}$ ion.
