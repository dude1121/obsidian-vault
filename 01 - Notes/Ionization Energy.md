The **ionization energy** is the amount of [[Energy|energy]] requires to remove an [[Electron|electron]] from a gaseous [[Atom|atom]] or [[Ion|ion]].
$$
\ce{X(g)->X+(g) + e-}
$$
where the atom or ion is assumed to be in its [[Ground State|ground state]]. Ionization energy is typically measured in kilo[[Joule|joules]] per [[Mole|mole]] $[\pu{ kJ/mol}]$. This energy is positive for neutral atoms, meaning that ionization is an [[Endothermic Process|endothermic process]]. As a rule of thumb, the closer the electron is to the [[Nucleus|nucleus]], the higher its ionization energy.

The table above lists the successive ionization energies for [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]] in the third [[Periodic Table|period]]. For the top 7 elements, the final ionization energy is the energy required to lose a *core electron*, that is, an electron not in the [[Valence Shell|valence shell]]. Note the large jump in ionization energy here.
