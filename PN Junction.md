A **pn junction** is formed when a material that have been [[Semiconductor Doping|doped]] to be n-type is attached to a material that is p-type doped. The junction is formed in the area where these materials meet. Since the n-type region is slightly negative, and the p-type region is slightly positive, some free [[Electron|electrons]] from the n-type region will move to fill the [[Hole Current|holes]] in the p-type region. This causes a build up of negative charges on the p-type side of the junction, and a build up of positive "holes" on the n-type side. This is known as the *depletion region*. The [[Voltage|voltage]] developed across this depletion region is known as the *[[barrier potential]]*.
