The **organizational structure** of an organization refers to the way in which its management hierarchy is structured. Three commonly used structures are *functional*, *project*, or *matrix*. 

# Functional Organizations

In a functional organization, each employee has one clear supervisor. Employees are grouped by specialty such as *production*, *marketing*, and *engineering*. Every department does their own [[Project|projects]] independent of the other department. 

## PM Pros
- Company doesn't have to restructure or disrupt operations
- Everybody really knows their stuff
- Everybody knows their place in the company

## PM Cons
- Too many layers to get through to talk to people
- Lack of customer focus
- Projects take longer because people are busy in their areas and have other priorities

# Project Organizations

Project organizations are on the opposite end of the spectrum from functional organizations. Team members are typically located together. The company only does projects.

## PM Pros
- Employees report to one person usually
- Communication is easier
- Promotes effective and speedy decision making
- Develop strong project managers
- Encourages rapid response to market opportunities

## PM Cons
- Setting up and maintaining teams can be expensive
- Potential for team members to develop loyalty to the project rather than to the organization
- Difficult to maintain a pooled supply of intellectual capital
- Concern among project team members about their future once the project ends

# Matrix Organizations

A matrix organization structure is a blend of the functional and project styles. In this structure, there are essentially two "bosses" for each employee, as they each fall under a PM as well as a VP for their department. 

## PM Pros
- Suited to dynamic environments
- Emphasizes the dual importance of project management and functional efficiency
- Promotes coordination across functional units
- Maximizes scarce resources between competing project and functional responsibilities

## PM Cons
- Dual hierarchies means two bosses
- Requires significant time to be spent negotiating the sharing of critical resources between projects and departments
- Can be frustrating for workers caught between competing project and functional demands
