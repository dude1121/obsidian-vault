A **statistic** is a numerical description of a [[Sample (Statistics)|sample]]. This is in contrast to a [[Parameter (Statistics)|parameter]] which is a description of a [[Population (Statistics)|population]]. Statistics may vary from sample to sample, but their corresponding parameter will be constant for the entire population.
