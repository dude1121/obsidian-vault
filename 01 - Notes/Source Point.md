In [[Electrodynamics|electrodynamics]], a **source point** is a point in [[Vector Space|vector space]] at which an electric [[Charge|charge]] is located. It is typically given in conjunction with a corresponding [[Field Point|field point]]. The [[Vector|vector]] that originates at the source point and ends at the field point is called the [[Separation Vector|separation vector]] $\pmb{\mathtt{r}}$.
