A **radian** is a unit of angle measure. It is defined as the angle subtended by an arc length equal to the radius of the arc. One radian is approximately equal to $57.296\degree$.  Typically radians are measured in rational expressions using $\pi$. For example, $90\degree$ or a *right* angle is expressed as $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in radians. 

To convert [[Degree|degrees]] to radians we use the relationship that $\pi \text{ rad}=180\degree$.
$$
\theta_{\text{rad}}=\frac{\pi}{180\degree}\theta_{\text{deg}}
$$
Likewise to convert from radians back into degrees we do the opposite,
$$
\theta_{\text{deg}}=\frac{180\degree}{\pi}\theta_{\text{rad}}
$$
