A **chemical reaction** is a change in the organization of the [[Atom|atoms]] in one or more substances. These reactions can take many different forms. 
# Chemical Equations
We can write the process of a chemical reaction as an equation. For example, methane $\ce{CH_{4}}$ in natural gas, when combined with oxygen $\ce{O_{2}}$ and burned, produces [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] $\ce{CO_{2}}$ and [[Water|water]] $\ce{H_{2}O}$. This can be represented with a chemical equation. On the left side of the equation are the *[[Reactant|reactants]]* and the *[[Product (Chemistry)|products]]* are on the right side, where both sides are separated by a right-facing arrow.
$$
\ce{CH_{4} + O_{2}-> CO_{2} + H_{2}O}
$$
Its important to remember that in a chemical reaction, all atoms present in the reactants must be accounted for among the products. There must be the same number of each type of atom on each side of the equation. Making sure this rule is obeyed is called *balancing a chemical equation*.

To make sure our above equation is balanced, let's count the atoms on each side.

| Reactant              | Count | Product               | Count |
| --------------------- | ----- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     | Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     |
| Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     | Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 2     |
| Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 2     | Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 3     |

Clearly our equation is not balanced. To fix this, we need to change the coefficients of each substance so that the atom count lines up. If we alter the equation like so,
$$
\ce{CH_{4} + 2O_{2}-> CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O}
$$
and then recount our atoms,

| Reactant              | Count | Product               | Count |
| --------------------- | ----- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     | Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     |
| Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     | Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     |
| Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 4     | Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 4     |
we now see that everything lines up, and the equation is balanced. Note that the formulas for each compound were not altered when the equation was balanced, only the coefficients. This balancing must occur due to the [[Law of Conservation of Mass]].
## Describing reactions in solution
For example when [[Aqueous|aqueous]] potassium chromate is mixed with aqueous barium nitrate a reaction occurs that forms a precipitate ($\ce{BaCrO_{4}}$) and dissolved potassium nitrate. We can write the overall *formula equation* as,
$$
\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}(aq) + Ba(NO_{3})2(aq) -> BaCrO_{4}(s) + 2KNO_{3}(aq)}
$$
We might however be interested in how the [[Ion|ions]] interact in this reaction, so we instead write the *complete ionic equation*,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ce{2K+(aq) + CrO_{4}^{2-}(aq) + Ba^{2+}(aq) + 2NO_{3}-(aq) -> 
\\ BaCrO_{4}(s) + 2K+(aq) + 2NO_{3}-(aq)} 
\end{aligned}
$$
Writing it this way better represents the actual forms of the reactants and products in the solution. In a complete ionic equation, *all substances that are [[Electrolytes|strong electrolytes]] are represented as ions*.
# Types of Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions can broadly be defined into three distinct categories: *precipitation reactions*, *acid-base reactions*, *oxidation-reduction reactions*. 
## Precipitation Reactions
When two [[Solution|solutions]] are mixed they can sometimes result a [[Solid|solid]] forming that separates from the solution. This solid that forms is called a [[Precipitate|precipitate]] and the reaction as a whole is called a *precipitation reaction*. 

Consider the reaction of potassium chromate $\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}(aq)}$ and barium nitrate $\ce{Ba(NO_{3})2(aq)}$. We can represent the mixing of these two compounds in two ways. First, we can write
$$
\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}(aq) + Ba(NO_{3})2(aq) -> products}
$$
However since in an aqueous solution these two compounds will be separated into their ions, it is more accurate to write
$$
\ce{2K+ + CrO_{4}^{2-} + Ba^{2+}(aq) + 2NO_{3}-(aq) -> products}
$$
When these two compounds are mixed, a yellow solid forms. To determine what that yellow solid is, we can look at the four ions that could possibly mix together. We know that ions with like charges will not bond, so $\ce{K+}$ and $\ce{Ba^{2+}}$ will not mix and neither will $\ce{CrO_{4}^{2-}}$ and $\ce{NO_{3}-}$. We also know that most [[Ionic Compound|ionic compounds]] contain only one anion and one cation. That means that the possible combinations are 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}}&&\ce{KNO_{3}}&&\ce{BaCrO_{4}}&&\ce{Ba(NO_{3})2}
\end{aligned}
$$
$\ce{K_{2}CrO4}$ and $\ce{Ba(NO_{3})2}$ are the reactants, so we know they're not the products. This leaves $\ce{KNO_{3}}$ and $\ce{BaCrO_{4}}$ as the possibilities. From experience, a chemist might know that $\ce{K+}$ and $\ce{NO_{3}-}$ ions are colourless, so that can't possibly be the yellow solid, meaning that $\ce{BaCrO_{4}}$ must be the yellow precipitate that forms. This means that our precipitation reaction equation is
$$
\ce{K_{2}CrO_{4}(aq) + Ba(NO_{3})2(aq) -> BaCrO_{4}(s) + KNO_{3}(aq)}
$$
## Acid-Base Reactions
Acid-base reactions are also known as *neutralization reactions*. Recall that an [[Acid|acid]] produces $\ce{H+}$ when dissolved and a [[Base|base]] produces $\ce{OH-}$ when dissolved. In general, an acid can be described as a [[Proton|proton]] donor and a base is a proton acceptor.

Consider mixing an aqueous solution of [[Acetic Acid|acetic acid]] and [[Potassium Hydroxide|potassium hydroxide]]. Acetic acid is a weak electrolyte, meaning it does not dissociate into ions well. However, potassium hydroxide dissolves very well, such that before any reaction begins, we can assume it has already split into ions $\ce{K+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$. Since we know that $\ce{KOH}$ is soluble, we know there will not be any precipitation in this reaction. But since $\ce{OH-}$ is a proton acceptor, and acetic acid has a proton it could donate, the [[Hydroxide|hydroxide]] could strip the proton from the acetic acid. The net ionic equation for this reaction is therefore
$$
\ce{OH- + HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}(aq) -> H_{2}O(l) + C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}-(aq)}
$$
A general principle for acid-base reactions emerges here.

>[!info] $\ce{OH-}$ in Acid-Base Reactions
>The hydroxide ion is such a strong base that for purposes of stoichiometric calculations it can be assumed to react completely with any weak acid that it encounters.

### Titrations
*Volumetric analysis* is a technique for determining the amount of a certain substance by doing a titration. Titration involves delivery (from a *buret*) of a measured volume of a solution of known [[Concentration|concentration]] (called the *titrant*) into a solution containing the substance being analyzed (the *analyte*). The point in the titration in which enough titrant has been added to react exactly with the analyte is the *equivalence point* or *stoichiometric point*. This is often marked by an *indicator*, a substance added at the beginning of the titration that changes colour very close to the equivalence point.
## Oxidation-Reduction Reactions
Reactions in which one or more electrons are transferred from one substance to another are called *oxidation-reduction reactions* or *redox reactions*. Everyday examples of redox reactions are [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]] in plants converting [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] and [[Water|water]] into [[Sugar|sugar]]. In fact, most reactions that result in a production of energy are redox reactions. Combustion reactions are another example of oxidation-reduction reactions. 
$$
\ce{CH_{4}(g) + 2O_{2}(g) -> CO_{2}(g) + 2H_{2}O(g) + energy}
$$
Even though none of these reactants or products are ionic, there is still a transfer of electrons from [[Carbon|carbon]] to [[Oxygen|oxygen]]. This is because of the [[Oxidation State|oxidation states]] of each atom. When describing a redox reaction, **oxidation** refers to an *increase* in oxidation state (a loss of electrons), **reduction** refers to a *decrease* in oxidation state (a gain of electrons), the **oxidizing agent** is the electron acceptor, and the **reducing agent** is the electron donor. 

In our above reaction, carbon goes from an oxidation state of $-4$ in the methane molecule to an oxidation state of $+4$ in the carbon dioxide. Oxygen goes from an oxidation state of $0$ when by itself to an oxidation state of $-2$ in both the $\ce{CO_{2}}$ and $\ce{H_{2}O}$. Hydrogen's oxidation state does not change as it is $-1$ in both methane and water. In summary then,

- Methane is *oxidized* because there is an increase in carbon's oxidation state.
- Oxygen is *reduced* because there is a decrease in its oxidation state.
- $\ce{CH4}$ is the *reducing agent*.
- $\ce{O2}$ is the *oxidizing agent*.
# Amount of products produced
Consider the following reaction:
$$
\ce{N_{2}(g) +3H_{2}(g)->2NH_{3}(g)}
$$
From this equation we can see that in order to produce two parts [[Ammonia|ammonia]], we must have one part [[Nitrogen|nitrogen gas]] and three parts [[Hydrogen|hydrogen gas]]. So, if there were $2\pu{ mol}$ of nitrogen and $6\pu{ mol}$ of hydrogen, we could produce $4\pu{ mol}$ of ammonia. This mixture would be called a [[Stoichiometric Mixture|stoichiometric mixture]] because the relative amounts of reactants matches the balanced equation. But what if we didn't have the perfect amount of each reactant?

In this case we would not be able to create the same amount of products. For example, what if we had $5\pu{ mol}$ of nitrogen and $9\pu{ mol}$ of hydrogen? If we assume the reaction goes until completion, we would have two possibilities: 1) we run out of hydrogen or 2) we run out of nitrogen. We can determine which will run out first by remembering that a balanced equation represents the relative number of molecules that will react. That is, *the ratio of numbers in the change row must be the same as the ratio of the coefficients in the balanced equation*. 

|        | **$\ce{N_{2}}$** | **$\ce{+}$** | **$\ce{3H_{2}}$** | **$\ce{->}$** | **$\ce{NH_{3}}$** |
| ------ |:----------------:| ------------ |:-----------------:| ------------- |:-----------------:|
| Before |        5         |              |         9         |               |         0         |
| Change |        -3        |              |        -9         |               |        +6         |
| After  |        2         |              |         0         |               |         6         |
This means that in this case, the hydrogen will run out first. This means that if we only have $9\pu{ mol}$ of hydrogen, it doesn't matter how much nitrogen we have (as long as its above $3\pu{ mol}$), we can only ever make $6\pu{ mol}$ of ammonia. We would call hydrogen in this case the [[Limiting Reagent|limiting reagent]].
