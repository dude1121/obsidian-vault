An **electron** (commonly denoted as $e^{^-}$) is a [[Subatomic Particle|subatomic particle]] that has a [[Charge|charge]] of $-1\ e$, where $e$ is the [[Elementary Charge]]. Electrons are an elementary particle, being both a [[Lepton|lepton]] and a [[Fermion|fermion]]. Electrons have an intrinsic [[Quantum Spin|spin]] of $1/2$. Electrons are also nearly massless, having approximately $1/1836$ the [[Mass|mass]] of a [[Proton|proton]].

Electrons give [[Atom|atoms]] their chemical properties. Since they carry charge, electrons also have their own [[electric field]]. Other [[Electromagnetic Field|electromagnetic fields]] will affect the motion of an electron, according to the [[Lorentz Force Law]]. 

# Discovery

Electrons were first described by English physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] who was studying electrical discharges in cathode ray tubes. He found that when a high [[Voltage|voltage]] was applied to the tube, a *cathode ray* was produced. This ray was produced at the negative electrode and it was repelled when put in the presence of the negative pole of an applied [[Electric Field|electric field]], so Thomson theorized that the ray must be a stream of negatively-charged particles. 

In these experiments, Thomson also was able to determine the electron's charge-to-mass ratio.
$$
\frac{e}{m}=-1.76\times 10^8\ \pu{ C}/\pu{ g}
$$
The mass of the electron was defined in 1909 by [[Robert Millikan]] to be
$$
m_{e}=9.11\times 10^{-31}\ \pu{ kg }
$$

# Chemistry

Electrons are what define an atom's ability to interact with other atoms.
