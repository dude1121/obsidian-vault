The **Electric Field** is a [[Field Force|field force]] that exists in the region of space around any given *charged object*, called the *source charge*. When another charged object, the *test charge*, enters this field, an electric [[Force|force]] acts on it. We define the electric field due to the source charge at the location of the test charge to be the electric force on the test charge *per unit charge*, or, to be more specific, *the electric field [[vector]]* $\vec{E}$ at a point in space is defined as the electric force $\vec{F_e}$ acting on a positive test charge $q_0$ placed at that point divided by the test charge:
$$
	\mathbf{\vec{E}}=\frac{\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{e}}{q_0}
$$
$\mathbf{\vec{E}}$ has the units $[\pu{ N/C}]$. Note that $\mathbf{\vec{E}}$ is the field *produced by* some charge *separate* from the test charge; it is not the field produced by the test charge itself. Also note that the presence of the test charge is not necessary for the field to exist. The test charge serves as a *detector* of the electric field that exists due to the source charge regardless of the existence of the test charge.

To find the strength of the electric field created by a charged particle at some given point, we can combine the equation above with [[Coulomb's Law]]. Recall that Coulomb's Law states:
$$
	\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{e}=k_e\frac{qq_0}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
$$
Substituting Coulomb's Law into our equation for $\vec{E}$,
$$
	\mathbf{\vec{E}}=k_e\frac{q}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
$$
This gives us the electric field generated by the source charge. Note that this field vector will point away from the test charge $q$ if $q$ is positive and towards the test charge $q$ if $q$ is negative. This, of course, assumes that the source charge is
# Electric field due to numerous point charges
Taking the relationship derived above,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{E}}=k_{e}\ \frac{q}{r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
$$
we can extend this concept further. What if there were more than just one point charge? In that case, the electric field would be the [[Vector#Vector Addition|vector sum]] of all the electric field vectors from each point charge.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{E}}=k_{e}\sum_{i}\ \frac{q_{i}}{r_{i}^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}_{i}
$$
where $r_{i}$ is the distance from the $i$th source charge $q_{i}$ to the source charge $P$ and $\mathbf{\hat{r}}_{i}$ is a unit vector directed from $q_{i}$ to $P$.
# Field lines
We can also represent the electric field as a series of lines called **electric field lines**. This idea was first introduced by [[Michael Faraday]]. These lines are related to the electric field by:
- The electric field vector $\vec{E}$ is tangent to the electric field line at each point. The line has a direction, indicated by an arrowhead, that is the same as that of the electric field vector. The direction of the line is that of the force on a positive test charge placed in the field.
- The number of lines per unit area through a surface perpendicular to the lines is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field in that region. Therefore, the field lines are close together where the electric field is strong and far apart where the field is weak.

In the above diagram, we see that the magnitude of the electric field is larger on surface A than on surface B. 

This can be more simply viewed by imagining a positive point charge in a 2D plane.

We can call these electric field lines *flux lines*. From this it is evident that closer to the particle, these flux lines are denser than the flux lines further away from the particle. The larger the charge of the particle, the greater the number of flux lines generated. Therefore, we can equate the charge with the *flux*,
