The **angular momentum** of a rotating body is the angular counterpart to [[Linear Momentum|linear momentum]]. It is measured in [[Kilogram|kilogram]]-[[Metre|metres]] squared per [[Second|second]] $[\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^2/s]$ and is typically assigned the symbol $\mathbf{\vec{L}}$. Angular momentum is a [[Vector|vector]] quantity. Like linear momentum, angular momentum must be *conserved*. It is defined by the relationship:
$$
\mathbf{\vec{L}}\equiv \mathbf{\vec{r}}\times \mathbf{\vec{p}}
$$
where $\mathbf{\vec{r}}$ is the position vector of some rotating point, and $\mathbf{\vec{p}}$ is the linear momentum of that point. Angular momentum is also related to [[Torque|torque]] by the relationship,
$$
\sum \vec{\mathbf{\pmb{\tau}}}=\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{L}}}{dt}
$$
Note the similarity to the relationship between [[Force|force]] and linear momentum.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{F}}=\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{p}}}{dt}
$$
Angular momentum has another parallel to linear momentum in its relationship to [[Angular Velocity|angular velocity]]. The two are connected by the relationship,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{L}}=I\pmb{\vec{\omega}}
$$
where $\pmb{\vec{\omega}}$ is the angular velocity and $I$ is the [[Moment of Inertia|moment of inertia]] of the object.
