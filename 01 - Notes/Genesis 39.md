[[Genesis 38|Previous]] [[Genesis 40|Next]]
# Summary
After our brief interlude with Judah, the narrative now flips back to [[Joseph]].
- *1*. In contrast with [[Genesis 37]], we are now told the *Ishmaelites* sold Joseph to [[Potiphar]], not the Midianites.
- *2 - 3*. Joseph becomes successful in service to Potiphar because "the LORD was with Joseph."
- *4*. Potiphar appoints Joseph in charge of all his household and all his possessions. 
- *5*. This is the fifth time that we read of God either being with Joseph or blessing Joseph. 
- *6 - 7*. Potiphar's wife asks Joseph to "lie" with her, since Joseph is apparently very "handsome and good-looking."
- *8 - 9*. Joseph refuses this offer. He reasons that Potiphar has given him everything in his house except his own wife, so it would be ungrateful and greedy to sleep with her. He calls it a "sin against God."
	- I wonder if this is a possible parallel to [[Adam]] and [[Eve]]. God gave them everything except told them not to eat of the [[Tree of Knowledge|tree of knowledge]]. Yet where Adam and Eve were unfaithful, Joseph remains resolute.
