# 1 Introduction
- John Reed's *Ten Days that Shook the World*.
- Origins of revolution can be traced back to the abolition of serfdom in 1861.
# 2 Autocracy and opposition
- While the Russian empire was vast, two-third of the population lived west of the Ural Mountains in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and the Caucasus. 
- [[Peter the Great]] had introduced reforms in the 1700s that essentially split Russia into two societies: the westernized *dvoryanstvo* (дворянство) which became the serf-owning nobility, and the peasantry or *narod* (народ) who were exploited by the dvoryanstvo.
- Russian Tsar was a total autocrat. Several reforms had been attempted but it wasn't until the [[First Russian Revolution]] in 1905 that a constitution was implemented and a Duma was established
	- This Duma was largely a show however as the Tsar still maintained absolute authority. The Tsar still had the authority to dissolve the Duma whenever he desired, something that happened twice between 1905 and 1917.
- Russia's lagging behind the rest of Europe technologically was showcased by its defeat in the [[Crimean War]].
- Russia then embarked on a program of industrialization and at the turn of the century was one of the world's leading industrial producers.
	- For the first time in history the country had a large industrial labour force (known by revolutionaries as the *[[Proletariat]]*) and an economically strong middle class of businessmen and owners (what [[Karl Marx|Marx]] called the [[Bourgeoisie]])
- Much of Russia was still agrarian though. Trotsky described Russia as being in a process of "combined development" where there were two simultaneous historical epochs in Russia: the medieval, agrarian, and semi-feudal peasantry, and the modern, industrial, capitalist cities.
- At the time the Russian army was the largest military force in the world
- After Russia's defeat in Crimea the military underwent a series of radical military reforms in the 1870s
- Despite this, the Russians face a military disaster against the Japanese in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]
- Despite some successes and advancements in science and culture, by and large the Russian population was illiterate
