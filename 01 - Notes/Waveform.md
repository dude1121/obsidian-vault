A **waveform** is a path traced by a given quantity plotted as a [[Function|function]] of some variable. This term is often used to describe the output of some [[Sinusoidal Function|sinusoid]] as a function of [[time]].

A periodic waveform can be broken down into a [[Fourier Series|series]] of [[Sine|sines]] and [[Cosine|cosines]] in a process called a [[Fourier Transform|Fourier transform]]. The primary frequency is called the [[Fundamental Frequency|fundamental frequency]] and the additional terms are the signal's [[Harmonic|harmonics]].
