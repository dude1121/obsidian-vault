[[Genesis 29|Previous]] [[Genesis 31|Next]]
# Summary
![[genesis-30-family-tree.png]]
- *1 - 3*. Like [[Sarah]], [[Rachel]] can't conceive so she arranges for Jacob to have a child with her maid [[Bilhah]]. 
- *6*. Bilhah gives birth to [[Dan (Person)|Dan]].
- *7*. Bilhah gives birth to [[Naphtali (Person)|Naphtali]]. 
- *9*. Leah stops bearing children (for now) and gives her maid [[Zilpah]] to Jacob to have more children. 
- *11 - 13*. Zilpah births both [[Gad (Person)|Gad]] and [[Asher (Person)|Asher]].
- *14*. [[Reuben (Person)|Reuben]] finds mandrakes, believed in ancient times to be an aphrodisiac. Reuben gives them to [[Leah]], but Rachel also asks for them.
- *15*. Leah is offended by this request, and Rachel tells Leah to lay with Jacob in exchange for the mandrakes.
- *17 - 21*. Leah gives birth to three more children: [[Issachar (Person)|Issachar]] and [[Zebulun (Person)|Zebulun]], two sons, and [[Dinah]], a daughter.
	- Dinah, unlike the sons of Jacob, does not yet get a story about her name. This may indicate that the fact that Leah gives birth to Dinah here is a later addition to foreshadow her tragic story in [[Genesis 34|chapter 34]].
- *22 - 24*. God "remembers" Rachel and gives her a son, [[Joseph]].
- *25*. Jacob asks [[Laban]] if he and his family can leave. This means that all of Jacob's children must have been born within Haran except for [[Benjamin (Person)|Benjamin]].
- *27*. Laban uses [[Divination|divination]] to learn that God will bless him because of Jacob.
- *32*. Jacob asks, as payment, to go through Laban's flock and take "all the speckled and spotted sheep and every black lamb," as well as the spotted and speckled goats.
- *35*. Laban again deceives Jacob and removes all the sheep that Jacob had asked for from his flock.
- *36*. Laban runs away, a distance of a three day journey.
- *37 - 40*. Ancient shepherds believed that female sheep would be influenced by what they saw when they bred, so putting spotted things (like poplar rods) in front of a female sheep would make her produce spotted offspring.
- *41 - 43*. Jacob breeds a larger flock to prepare to leave Laban.
# Thoughts
It is funny how much superstition is present in Genesis. We see the belief in mandrakes bringing fertility (and it working) and the spotted poplar rods with Jacob, and even Laban's divination.
