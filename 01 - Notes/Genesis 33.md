[[Genesis 32|Previous]] [[Genesis 34|Next]]
# Summary
- *4*. [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] are reunited.
- *11*. Esau accepts Jacob's gift at Jacob's insistence.
- *13 - 17*. Esau and Jacob part ways: Esau goes back to [[Seir]] and Jacob goes to settle in a place he names [[Succoth]]. Esau had originally suggested they travel together but Jacob sends him on his way.
- *18*. Jacob moves on from Succoth to [[Shechem]]. It is also revealed in this verse that the place Esau and Jacob reunited was called [[Paddan-aram]].
- *19 - 20*. In the city of Shechem, Jacob buys a plot of land from a man named [[Shechem, son of Hamor]] for 100 *qesitah*. He erects an altar here called El-elohe-Israel, meaning 'God, the god of Israel' or perhaps more literally, '[[El]], the god of Israel'.
# Thoughts
Not a whole lot here. 

This marks the return of Shechem into the narrative for the first time since [[Genesis 12]]. Interestingly in that account [[Abraham]] encounters Shechem after parting ways with [[Lot]], seemingly Jacob and Esau make up a slight parallel.
