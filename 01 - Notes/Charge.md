Electric **charge** is a property of [[Matter|matter]] that causes it to experience a [[Force|force]] when placed in an [[Electric Field|electric]] or [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]] (often combined into one [[Electromagnetic Field|electromagnetic field]]). Charge can be *positive* or *negative* with like charges repelling one another and opposite charges attracting one another. If something does not have any net charge we call it *electrically neutral*. Charge is commonly denoted with the symbol $q$ and is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Coulomb|coulombs]] $[\text{C}]$. Much like [[Mass|mass]] or [[Energy|energy]], charge is a *conserved* quantity, meaning that in an isolated system the net amount of charge must remain constant. 

In 1909 it was discovered by [[Robert Millikan]] that electric charge always occurs as integer multiple of a fundamental amount of charge, $e$. That is, charge is *quantized* and only exists as some multiple of the [[Elementary Charge|elementary charge]], $q=\pm Ne$ where $N \in \mathbb{Z}$. [[Electron|Electrons]] have a charge of $q_{e}=-e$ and [[Proton|protons]] have a charge of $q_{p}=+e$.
