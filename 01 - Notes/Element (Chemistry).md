In chemistry, an **element** is a pure substance that can not be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Elements are made of incredibly small [[Particles|particles]] called [[Atom|atoms]]. Elements are identified and distinguished by the number of [[Proton|protons]] in their [[Nucleus|nucleus]], which is also defined as the element's [[Atomic Number|atomic number]] $Z$. Elements can be combined to form more complex [[Compound|compounds]] and [[Molecule|molecules]], or they can be transformed into other elements by changing the atomic number in a [[Nuclear Reaction|nuclear reaction]].

The known elements are often displayed organized into the [[Periodic Table]].
