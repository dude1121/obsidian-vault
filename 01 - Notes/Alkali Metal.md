An **alkali metal** is an element in the first group of the [[Periodic Table|periodic table]], excluding [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]]. The alkali metals include:
- [[Lithium]] $\ce{_{3}Li}$
- [[Sodium]] $\ce{_{11}Na}$
- [[Potassium]] $\ce{_{19}K}$
- [[Rubidium]] $\ce{_{37}Rb}$
- [[Cesium]] $\ce{_{55}Cs}$
- [[Francium]] $\ce{_{87}Fr}$
Alkali metals are all shiny, soft, highly [[Reactivity|reactive]] metals at [[Standard Temperature and Pressure|standard temperature and pressure]]. Alkali metals most commonly form [[Ion|cations]] with [[Charge|charge]] $+1$. They are found naturally only in [[Ionic Compound|salts]] and never by themselves as free [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]]. Cesium is the most reactive metal, but all will react with air and violently react with [[Water|water]].

All alkali metals have one [[Valence Shell|valence electron]], which makes them very reactive with the [[Halogen|halogens]].
