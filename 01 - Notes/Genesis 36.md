[[Genesis 35|Previous]] [[Genesis 37|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 5*. [[Esau|Esau's]] children.
	- Are Basemath and Mahalath the same person?
- *6 - 8*. This verse seems to echo the parting of [[Abraham]] and [[Lot]], something I mentioned back in [[Genesis 33]]. 
- *9 - 19*. This section lists Esau's descendants and the family tree of the [[Edomites]].
- *20 - 30*. From here we get a list of the clans present in [[Seir]] (cf. [[Deuteronomy 2]])
	- Part of this traces the lineage of Esau's wife, Oholibamah.
- *31*. This verse notes that kings eventually reigned over the [[Israelites]]. This would seem to heavily discredit Mosaic authorship since the Kings of Israel were hundreds of years past his time.
# Thoughts
It seems these genealogy chapters always give evidence of non-Mosaic authorship. The *Insight* book says this is an example of Moses 'foretelling' that Israel would eventually have a king, but to me this comes across as lazy.
