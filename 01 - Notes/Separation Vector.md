In [[Electrodynamics|electrodynamics]], a **separation vector** $\pmb{\mathtt{r}}$ is a vector that is directed from a [[Source Point|source point]] to the [[Field Point|field point]]. It is therefore defined as, 
$$
\pmb{\mathscr{r}} = \mathbf{\vec{r}} -\mathbf{\vec{r'}}
$$
It has a magnitude of,
$$
\mathscr{r}=|\mathbf{\vec{r}}-\mathbf{\vec{r'}}|
$$
and a [[Unit Vector|unit vector]] in the direction from $\mathbf{\vec{r'}}$ to $\mathbf{\vec{r}}$ is,
$$
\hat{\pmb{\mathtt{r}}}= \frac{\pmb{\mathtt{r}}}{\mathtt{r}}
$$
