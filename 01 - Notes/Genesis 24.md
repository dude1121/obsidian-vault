[[Genesis 23|Previous]] [[Genesis 25|Next]]
# Summary
- *2*. Placing one's hand under another's thigh was apparently an ancient custom for oath-taking.
- *3 - 4*. [[Abraham]] wants [[Isaac]] to have a wife from his family, not the [[Canaan|Canaanites]].
- *12 - 14*. Abraham's servant's prayer to find a wife for Isaac. In this prayer he asks that the woman he has been sent for ought to offer him a drink when he asks, and she will further offer to let his camels drink.
- *15*. [[Rebekah]] is first mentioned.
- *15 - 21*. The first interaction with Rebekah involves her drawing water for Abraham's servant as well as his camels. She is described as "very fair to look upon, a virgin."
- *22*. Why did the servant have this jewellery? Did Rebekah wear a nose ring?
- *28 - 32*. [[Laban]] invites the servant in.
- *33 - 49*. The servant relates his task and his account of meeting Rebekah.
	- *47*. Yes, Rebekah was wearing a nose ring.
- *50 - 51*. Laban and [[Bethuel]] give Rebekah in marriage.
- *55*. Laban and his mother demand that Rebekah stay just 10 days more.
- *58*. Rebekah goes immediately and does not wait the 10 days.
- *59*. Rebekah is blessed by her brother and mother in a similar vein to how Isaac and Abraham have been blessed, i.e., with promises of becoming many ('become thousands of myriads'), but with an additional promise of her 'offspring \[gaining] possession of the gates of their foes', definitely hinting at the conquest of the [[Promised Land|promised land]].
- *65*. Upon seeing Isaac, Rebekah covers herself with a veil. 
- *67*. Isaac and Rebekah are married.
	- Note the parallel in women being a "comfort" for men just as [[Eve]] was a comfort for [[Adam]]. 
# Thoughts
This chapter is a much more respectful image of women than is typical in the Bible. Still not perfect, but better. Interesting though about the jewelry, I never noticed that before.

Nothing here is ground breaking or controversial, though. This is simply biblical history.
