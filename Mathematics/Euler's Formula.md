**Euler's Formula** is a formula named after [[Leonhard Euler]] that establishes the link between [[Complex Numbers|complex numbers]] and [[Trigonometric Functions|trigonometric functions]]. It states,
$$
e^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x
$$
where $e$ is [[Euler's Number]], $i$ is the imaginary unit, and $x \in \mathbb{R}$.

If $x=\pi$ in this formula, [[Euler's Identity]] emerges.
$$
\begin{aligned}
e^{i\pi}&=\cos \pi+i\sin \pi\\
&=-1+i 0 \\
&=-1
\end{aligned}
$$
