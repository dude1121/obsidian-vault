The **position** of an object or particle is the location of that object with respect to some chosen reference point. Position is a [[Vector|vector]] quantity and is typically denoted with the symbol $\vec{r}$ (or, if the position is one-dimensional, it might be denoted with $x$, $y$, or $z$). If the object changes its position, we call this change in position its [[Displacement|displacement]]. How much the position $\vec{r}$ of an object varies with [[Time|time]] is known as its [[Velocity|velocity]]. Put another way, velocity is the time [[Derivative|derivative]] of position.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{v}}=\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{r}}}{dt}
$$
This also means that displacement is the [[Integral|integral]] of velocity.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{r}}=\int \mathbf{\vec{v}}\ dt
$$
Position is measured in [[Metre|metres]] $[\pu{ m}]$. The position vector is defined as:
$$
\mathbf{\vec{r}}\equiv x\mathbf{\hat{i}}+y\mathbf{\hat{j}}+z\mathbf{\hat{k}}
$$
