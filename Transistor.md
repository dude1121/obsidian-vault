A **transistor** is a [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]] device that can either [[Amplification|amplify]] or switch electrical signals. Typically a transistor consists of 3 terminals, with one of the terminals controlling the [[Voltage|voltage]] across or [[Current|current]] through the other two terminals.

# Transistor Types

The most commonly used kind of transistor is a [[FETs|Field Effect Transistor]] (FET), specifically [[MOSFET|Metal Oxide Semiconductor FETs]] (MOSFETs). Related to MOSFETs are [[JFET|Junction Field Effect Transistors]] (JFETs). The most common non-FET transistor is the [[BJT|Bipolar Junction Transistor]] (BJT).
