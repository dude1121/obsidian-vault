**DC Electricity** (or, *Direct [[Current]]* electricity) is a form of electricity in which the current in a circuit flows in only one direction. This means that circuit values like [[Voltage|voltage]] and current are not time-varying, unlike in an [[AC Electricity|ac circuit]], and therefore there are no [[Reactance|reactive]] components to a dc circuit.
