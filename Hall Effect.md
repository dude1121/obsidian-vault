The **Hall effect** is a phenomenon that occurs when a semiconductor with a constant current through it interacts with a [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]]. 
![[hall-effect.webp]]
When a magnetic field interacts with the semiconductor, a voltage is generated that is *proportional* to the strength of the magnetic field. That is,
$$
V_{\mathrm{H}}\propto B
$$
This voltage, called the *Hall voltage*, is typically very small, on the order of millivolts. If the current and other properties about the material are held constant, we can use this fact to design a sensor that detects the presence of a magnetic field. This is known as a [[Hall Effect Sensor|Hall effect sensor]].
