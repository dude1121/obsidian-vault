**Velocity** is the change in an object's [[Position|position]] with respect to [[Time|time]]. Put another way, velocity is an object's [[Displacement|displacement]] over time. This also makes velocity the time [[Derivative|derivative]] of position.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{v}}=\frac{\mathbf{\vec{d}}}{t}=\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{r}}}{dt}
$$
If the time is not an infinitesimal quantity and instead is some range, the velocity over this period is the *average* velocity, not the *instantaneous* velocity. If the velocity varies with time, this variation is called the object's [[Acceleration|acceleration]]. That is, acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and velocity is the [[Integral|integral]] of acceleration.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{a}}=\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{\vec{v}}
$$
$$
\mathbf{\vec{v}}=\int \mathbf{\vec{a}}\ dt
$$As noted with the boldface and arrows above $\mathbf{v}$, velocity is a [[Vector|vector]]. Its scalar counterpart is [[Speed|speed]]. Velocity is measured in [[Metre|metres]] per [[Second|second]] $[\pu{ m/s}]$.

# Velocity of a centre of mass

If the object under examination is not a point particle but rather a [[Rigid Body|rigid body]], the velocity of that body, also known as the velocity of the [[Centre of Mass|centre of mass]] of the system, is given by,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{\text{CM}}=\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{r}}_{\text{CM}}}{dt}=\frac{1}{M}\displaystyle \sum_{i}m_{i}\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{r}}_{i}}{dt}=\frac{1}{M}\displaystyle \sum_{i}m_{i}\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{i}
$$
This quantity, $\mathbf{\vec{v}}_{\text{CM}}$, is useful for defining the total [[Linear Momentum|linear momentum]] of a system.

# Relation to momentum

The linear momentum of an object or system of particles is directly proportional to its velocity, with the [[Mass|mass]] of the system being the proportionality constant.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{p}}=m\mathbf{\vec{v}}
$$

# Relation to angular velocity

Velocity's angular counterpart, [[Angular Velocity|angular velocity]], is related to linear velocity by the relationship,
$$
v=r\omega 
$$
and by extension, using vector quantities,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{v}}=\mathbf{\vec{r}}\times \mathbf{\vec{\omega}}
$$
