> **Efficiency** is a measure of how well a system or component is able to perform a given task, expressed as a percentage.

We use the Greek letter $\mathrm{\eta}$ to express efficiency. Algebraically we can express it as,
$$
	\eta=\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}\cdot100\%
$$
In any real, non-theoretical process, there will be losses due to inefficiencies within the system. Efficiency allows us to quantify how much of the input power is lost due to these inefficiencies.
