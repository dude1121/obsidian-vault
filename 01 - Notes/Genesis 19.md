[[Genesis 18|Previous]] [[Genesis 20|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 3*. [[Lot]] meets the [[Angel|angels]] in [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]].
- *4 - 5*. Townspeople demand Lot bring these visitors out so they can rape (lit. "know") them.
- *8*. Lot declines, but he instead offers his daughters to them ??
- *10 - 11*. The angels intervene and blind the mob to save Lot from being killed.
- *14*. Interesting that even though they weren't yet married, these men are referred to as Lot's sons-in-law.
- *16*. Lot lingers before leaving, so the angels grab his hands and lead his family out of the city.
- *18 - 19*. Lot argues with the angels, complaining that he can't flee to the mountains but instead wants to go to [[Zoar]].
- *24*. Rain motif. Rain represents destruction / punishment.
- *26*. [[Wife of Lot|Lot's wife]] looks back on the destruction and becomes a pillar of salt.
	- The [[New Oxford Annotated Bible|NOAB]] notes that this may be an attempt to explain the large salt deposits near the Dead Sea.
- *30*. Lot leaves Zoar and goes to the mountains where he lives in a cave with his daughters.
- *31 - 36*. Both daughters rape their father after getting him drunk and become pregnant.
- *37 - 38*. Lot is then father to two sons: [[Moabites|Moab]] and [[Ammonites|Ben-ammi]], who turn into the Moabites and Ammonites, respectively.
# Thoughts
The overt themes and mention of rape here are uncomfortable, to say the least.

First, how is Lot seen as 'righteous' in [[2 Peter]] 2.7? Lot here instead seems cowardly. He betrays his own daughters by offering them to be raped by an angry mob. He delays leaving Sodom despite the angels telling him he has to go to the point that the angels have to *drag* him and his family out. Then, even after being saved, he complains about having to live in the mountains and makes the angels let him go to Zoar. He then later ends up in the mountains anyways!

Secondly, what is the deal with the daughters raping Lot? If sexual depravity was why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah (more on that below), why do Lot's daughters get to live? Is getting your own father drunk and raping him not depraved enough? Or is it okay because Lot was a patriarch?

Finally, why did God destroy Sodom and Gomorrah? *w90 4/15 pp.16 - 21, Â¶2* states that it was because they "indulged in wrong-doing in a manner that displayed brazen disrespect, even contempt, for law and authority." Fair, but why were they singled out for destruction? Was it just because of their sexuality? Why did God not rain fire and brimstone on other 'immoral' cities like those of the Sumerians, Egyptians, or even the later ancient Greeks?
