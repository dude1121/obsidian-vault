**Strain** is a measure of the degree of [[Elasticity in Solids|deformation]] of an object when subjected to some [[Stress|stress]]. There are three main types of strain: *tensile*, *shear*, and *volumetric*. They are defined as,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon_{\text{t}}=\frac{\Delta L}{L_{i}}&&\gamma_{xy}=\frac{\Delta x}{h}&&\delta=\frac{\Delta V}{V_{i}}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
In each case, strain is a ratio of some change in a quantity (length or volume) over the initial value of that quantity. As such, strain is a unitless ratio.
