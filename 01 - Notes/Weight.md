The **weight** of an object is the [[Force|force]] acting upon that object due to [[Gravity|gravity]]. It is typically a [[Vector|vector]] quantity pointing downward. The weight of an object is proportional, but not equal to, the object's [[Mass|mass]]. On earth, the weight of an object is typically given as,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{g}=m\mathbf{\vec{g}}
$$
where $\mathbf{\vec{F}}_{g}$ is the [[Gravitational Force|gravitational force]] acting upon the object, i.e. its weight, measured in [[Newton|newtons]] $[\pu{ N}]$, $m$ is the object's mass in [[Kilogram|kilograms]] $[\pu{ kg}]$, and $\mathbf{\vec{g}}$ is the [[Acceleration|acceleration]] due to gravity, typically a constant at $9.801\ \pu{ m/s^2}$.
