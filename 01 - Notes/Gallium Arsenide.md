**Gallium arsenide** (GaAs) is a [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]] [[Compound|compound]] made from [[Gallium|gallium]] and [[Arsenic|arsenide]]. Gallium arsenide performs well at [[Microwave|microwave]] [[Frequency|frequencies]], much better than [[Silicon|silicon]], such that for most [[Radio|RF]] frequency ($20\pu{ kHz}\leq f \leq 300\pu{ Ghz}$) applications, GaAs transistors are used instead of silicon based transistors. However at upper ends of that spectrum, GaAs might be replaced by [[Gallium Nitride|gallium nitride]] semiconductors, as they have a better response at higher [[Temperature|temperatures]] and [[Voltage|voltages]] than gallium arsenide.
