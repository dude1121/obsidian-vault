Need Mechanical to update their equipment locations for updated storage and laundry rooms on ground floor.
### Changes
- Common Rm & Dining 008
	- South wall moved slightly to the south. Minor impact on electrical.
	- Automatic door opener added to south door.
- Laundry 027 & Storage Room 4 028
	- These rooms flipped. Overall electrical design & circuiting remains the same but locations obviously change. Sump pump and sump pump control panel remain in their previous locations.
- North Corridor 030
	- Door 030 added ADO
- Program Room 024
	- Door added ADO, ES, and CR.
- South Corridor 031
	- Door 031B gains card reader, electric strike, automatic door opener, magnetic lock.
		- Already had CR, ES, and ML. Added ADO.
- Units 102 & 103
	- Bedroom walls moved. This affected the distance between receptacles along 'usable wall space' (see [[CEC s.26#26-722 Receptacles for dwelling units|OESC 26-722]]) so receptacles had to be moved further down the wall. This is most noticeable in Unit 103.
- All first floor units
	- Units that previously had an ADO c/w CR and ES now no longer have the CR.
- Common Rm / Lounge 125
	- Door operator previously not circuited. Added cct on panel RS1.
- Units 210, 219
	- ADO, ES, and CR are now rough-in only.
- Units 202 & 203
	- Same deal as units 102 / 103. 
- Units 223 & 224
	- Arch changes, moved wall adjoining the two units. This does not merit a rev cloud however as receptacles remain along the wall in the same relative location.
