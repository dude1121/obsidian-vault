**Statistics** is a branch of mathematics. It is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting [[Data (Statistics)|data]] to make decisions. Statistics is interested in the analysis of data sets called [[Population (Statistics)|populations]] and [[Sample (Statistics)|samples]].  These two data sets lead to two different terms used to numerically describe their characteristics: for populations, this term is called a [[Parameter (Statistics)|parameter]]; for samples this term is called a [[Statistic|statistic]].
