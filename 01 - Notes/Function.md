A **function** is an assignment of unique inputs to unique outputs. In the language of [[Set|sets]], a function from set $X$ to set $Y$ is an assignment of one element of set $X$ to exactly one element of set $Y$. Put differently,
$$
\forall x \in X,\exists y \in Y 
$$
The set $X$ is called the [[Domain|domain]] of the function and the set $Y$ is the [[Codomain|codomain]]. A function $f$ may be specified by the notation $f:X\to Y$. This could alternatively be written $x \mapsto y$. 

# Functional Notation

This type of notation requires the function be named, and in general the typical name of an arbitrary function is $f$. If more functions are defined this becomes $g$ then $h$, and so on. The name of the function is followed by its argument(s). E.g.
$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x)&&\sin(\pi)&&f(x^3+1)
\end{aligned}
$$
The argument can be a variable, a value within the function's domain, or an expression.
