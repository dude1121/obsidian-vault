In electrical engineering, **real power** is a term used for [[Power|power]] that actually does work in a circuit, whether that be by being converted to [[Thermal Energy|heat]] or being used in something like a [[Motor|motor]]. Real power (or sometimes called *active power*) is commonly denoted with $P$ and is measured in [[Watt|watts]] $[\pu{ W}]$. Real power is contrasted with [[Reactive Power|reactive]] and [[Apparent Power|apparent]] power, which together are used to describe power in an [[AC Electricity|ac]] circuit. [[DC Electricity|Dc]] circuits contain only real power, therefore in a dc circuit real power is,
$$
P=VI=I^2R=\frac{V^2}{R}
$$
In an ac circuit, the [[Power Factor|power factor]] $F_{p}$ must be taken into consideration.
$$
P_{\text{ac}}=VI\cos \theta=I^2Z\cos \theta=\frac{V^2}{Z}\cos \theta
$$
where $Z$ is the circuit [[Impedance|impedance]].
