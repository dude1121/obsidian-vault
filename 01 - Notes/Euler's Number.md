**Euler's Number** $e$ is a [[Transcendental Number|transcendental]] mathematical [[Constant|constant]]. Its decimal representation is approximately,
$$
e=2.71828\dots
$$
$e$ can also be defined in other ways. The [[Limit|limit]] definition of $e$ is,
$$
e=\lim_{ n \to \infty }\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n 
$$
this definition has its roots in the idea of compounding interest. This number also has a definition as the sum of an [[Series|infinite series]], namely,
$$
e=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}=1+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2!}+\frac{1}{3!}+\dots
$$
