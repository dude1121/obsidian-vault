**Fascism** is a political ideology that historically dominated much of central, southern, and eastern Europe from the end of [[World War I]] to the end of [[World War II]]. The creator of fascism is commonly attributed to [[Benito Mussolini]] who took his party's name from the Latin word *fasces*, meaning bundle or union.

Different fascist movements have had differences between them, but common characteristics of fascism include:
- Extreme militaristic nationalism
- Contempt for electoral democracy, political and cultural liberalism
- Belief in social hierarchy and rule of the elites (meritocracy)
- Desire to create a *Volksgemeinschaft* (German for "people's community") in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation
After WWII major fascist parties were disbanded and in some former fascist countries like [[Italy]] and [[West Germany]] fascism was banned outright.
