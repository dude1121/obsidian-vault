[[Genesis 8|Previous]] [[Genesis 10|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. Retelling of the last bit of [[Genesis 8|chapter 8]].
	- As with the story of creation itself, the story of re-creation also has multiple accounts.
- *2*. Animals now have fear of humans.
- *3*. Animals are now food for humans.
- *4*. Do not eat blood.
- *6*. Do not murder. Life for life.
- *11*. This time, God promises not to use a flood to kill everyone, not that we won't do it at all.
- *13, 14*. God sets down his 'bow' in the clouds as a sign of this covenant. (Rainbow)
- *20 - 29*. [[Noah]] gets drunk and was laying naked in his tent. [[Ham]] saw this and didn't cover Noah up, whereas [[Japheth]] and [[Shem]] did. Therefore, Ham's descendants ([[Canaan]]) are cursed to be slaves to Japheth and Shem's descendants.
- *29*. Noah dies at 950 years old.
# Thoughts
Verse 4 becomes very important to JWs and their refusal to accept [[The Blood Issue|blood transfusions]].
