A **communication system** is a system whose function is to transfer [[Information|information]] from one point to another. This system can be represented by three distinct, fundamental components: a [[Transmitter|transmitter]], a [[Receiver|receiver]] (collectively known as [[Transducer|transducers]] or [[Transceiver|transceivers]]), and a [[Channel|channel]]. The characteristics of the system's channel largely dictate the maximum information capacity of the system. 

To transmit information in the form of a relatively low [[Frequency|frequency]] signal (often referred to as the [[Intelligence|intelligence]]), the signal is superimposed on top of a higher frequency [[Carrier|carrier]] signal for transmission. This process is called [[Modulation|modulation]]. When the signal is received by the receiver, it is then *de*modulated to remove the carrier from the transmission.
