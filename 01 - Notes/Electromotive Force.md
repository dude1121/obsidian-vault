The **Electromotive force** (emf) is an energy transfer to an electrical circuit per unit of [[Charge|charge]]. It is measured in [[Volts|volts]]. The energy conversion is accomplished by means of physical [[Force|forces]] applying physical [[Work|work]] on electric charges. However, emf is not a force itself, and sometimes the terms *source tension* or *source voltage* may be used instead, sometimes denoted as $U_{s}$.

Note that although measured in volts, emf is not the same phenomenon as [[Voltage]]. Voltage, as we define it, is a difference in electrical potential, whereas emf is generated due to a difference in potential. In a simple circuit with a battery and a resistor, the battery provides emf, but the difference in potential is across the resistor.
