**Stress** is a quality of an object that is proportional to the [[Force|force]] applied that causes a [[Elasticity in Solids|deformation]]. It is the applied force per unit cross-sectional [[Area|area]]. The result of stress is [[Strain|strain]]. Stress is typically defined as
$$
\sigma=\frac{F}{A}
$$
but should not be confused with [[Pressure|pressure]], which is also force over area. Depending on applications, stress may be given a different variable. For example, shear stress is usually designated $\tau$. 

*Shear stress* $\tau$ is stress applied to an object when an object is subjected to a force parallel to one of  its faces while the opposite face is held fixed by another force. An example is shown below.
