**Inductance** is a measure of the strength of a magnetic field generated around a coil (or, [[Inductor|inductor]]) due to an applied current. The higher the inductance, the stronger the magnetic field. It is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Henries]] after the American physicist *Joseph Henry*. 

If an inductor will establish a [[Voltage|voltage]] of $1\text{V}$ across the coil due to a change in [[Current|current]] of $1\text{A/s}$, it is said to have an inductance of $1\text{H}$.

Inductance is typically denoted with an $L$. The inductance of an inductor can be determined from its construction by,
$$
L=\frac{\mu N^2 A}{\ell}
$$
where $\mu$ is the [[Permeability|permeability]] of the core material in [[Webers|webers]] per [[Amperes|ampere]]-[[Metre|metre]]  $[\text{Wb/Am}]$, $N$ is the number of turns of wire in the coil (typically unitless but sometimes marked with a $t$ for *turns*), $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the space within the coil $[\text{m}^2]$, and $\ell$ is the length of the coil $[\text{m}]$.
