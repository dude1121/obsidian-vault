According to the [[Canadian Electrical Code|CEC]], **grounding** is a connection between the electrical system and the earth. The CEC defines it as,
>[!quote] Grounding
a permanent and continuous conductive path to the earth with sufficient ampacity to carry any fault current liable to be imposed on it, and of a sufficiently low impedance to limit the voltage rise above ground and to facilitate the operation of the protective devices in the circuit.

This is not to be confused with [[Bonding|bonding]] which is a similar but separate topic. Put succinctly, bonding is part of the act of grounding, however bonding typically connects all circuits to one common ground. In the CEC, grounding is covered in [[CEC s.10|section 10]].
