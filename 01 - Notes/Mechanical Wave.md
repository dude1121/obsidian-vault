A **mechanical wave** is one of the main types of waves (the other being [[Electromagnetic Radiation|electromagnetic]]). Like EM waves, mechanical waves are a form of [[Energy|energy]] transfer. All mechanical waves have three requirements:
1. Some source of disturbance
2. A medium containing elements that can be disturbed
3. Some physical mechanism through which elements of the medium can influence one another
