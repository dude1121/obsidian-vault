**Hartley's Law** is a law in telecommunications and [[Information Theory|information theory]]. It was proposed by American researcher [[Ralph Hartley]].  It states that the amount of [[Information|information]] transmitted is directly proportional to the [[Bandwidth|bandwidth]] $\Delta f$ and the [[Time|time]] of transmission $t$. 
$$
I\propto \Delta f\cdot t
$$
