[[Genesis 27|Previous]] [[Genesis 29|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 5*. In this account, instead of [[Rebekah]] sending [[Jacob]] away to protect him from [[Esau]], [[Isaac]] sends Jacob to [[Laban]] of his own volition.
	- Future note. I don't think this is a fair critique as it seems this verse is simply a continuation from the end of the last chapter where Rebekah pleaded with Isaac to not let him marry a [[Hittites|Hittite]] woman.
- *9*. Esau takes Mahalath (daughter of [[Ishmael]]) as an additional wife.
- *10*. Jacob leaves Beer-sheba and heads towards Haran.
- *11 - 17*. While on the way to Haran, Jacob dreams of a ladder (or possibly, stairway) from earth to [[Heaven|heaven]], and [[Angel|angels]] are ascending and descending the ladder. 
- *14*. Like his father and [[Abraham|grandfather]], Jacob receives a promise of a large offspring and that his offspring will live in this land.
- *17*. Jacob says that the place he is in is God's house, the gate of heaven.
- *18 - 19*. Jacob takes the stone he laid his head on when he saw the vision and he builds a pillar with the stone on top and he pours oil on it. He names the place '[[Bethel]]'. Formerly known as 'Luz'.
	- In this verse Bethel is depicted as an unsettled place but in [[Genesis 12|Gen 12.8]] Abraham is recorded as to have settled between Bethel and [[Ai (Biblical Location)|Ai]]. Did Bethel exist in Abraham's time? Or was the author referring to a city that *would* exist (i.e. 'he settled in between *what would become* Bethel...')?
- *20 - 22*. Jacob vows that if God protects him, he and his descendants will return to Bethel. He also promises to gives a [[Tithe|tithe]] back to God.
# Thoughts
Jacob parallels Isaac and Abraham again by receiving a promise from God to multiply his offspring.

Also interesting is the naming of Bethel. Yet again we see this where a place is given a name after it has already been mentioned.
