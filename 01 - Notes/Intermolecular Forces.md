**Intermolecular forces** are forces present within a substance due to the [[Polar Molecule|polarity]] of the [[Molecule|molecules]] in that substance. There are three main types of intermolecular forces: *London dispersion*, *dipole-dipole*, and *hydrogen bonding*.
# London dispersion
London dispersion forces are forces present between molecules that are nonpolar or noble gases. Even though these molecules are nonpolar, as the [[Electron|electrons]] move about the [[Nucleus|nucleus]], a momentary nonsymmetrical electron distribution can develop that produces a temporary dipolar arrangement of [[Charge|charge]]. This can, in turn, affect the electron distribution of a neighbouring [[Atom|atom]]. This *instantaneous* dipole can induce a similar dipole in a neighbouring atom. This leads to an interatomic attraction that is relatively weak and short-lived but can be very significant especially for large atoms.

In order for these forces to be strong enough to produce a solid, the motions of the atoms must be greatly slowed down which is why molecules attracted solely by London dispersion forces typically have much lower [[Freezing Point|freezing points]].
# Dipole-dipole
If the molecules interacting have [[Polar Molecule|dipole moments]], then the forces that hold these molecules together are called dipole-dipole interactions. In a condensed state like a [[Liquid|liquid]], the dipoles within the substance will align themselves to compromise between attraction and repulsion. That is, the molecules will orient themselves to maximize $\ce{+ ..\ ..  -}$ interactions but minimize $\ce{+ ..\ .. +}$ and $\ce{- ..\ .. -}$ interactions.

These forces are about $1\%$ as strong as covalent or ionic bonds and their strength rapidly decreases (due to the [[Coulomb's Law|coulomb force]]) the further apart they are. While in the [[Gas|gaseous]] state at low pressures, these molecules are further apart and the dipole-dipole interactions are almost negligible. 
# Hydrogen bonding
Hydrogen bonds are a special case of dipole-dipole interactions. If [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] is bound to a particularly [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] atom (e.g. [[Nitrogen|nitrogen]], [[Oxygen|oxygen]], or [[Fluorine|fluorine]]) the dipole-dipole forces between molecules are very strong. This is for two primary reasons:
1) hydrogen-bound molecules typically have very large dipole moments and
2) molecules can interact very closely due to hydrogen's small size
