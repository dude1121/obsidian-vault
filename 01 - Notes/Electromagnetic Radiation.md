**Electromagnetic radiation** is a manner in which [[Energy|energy]] travels through space. Electromagnetic (EM) waves, unlike [[Mechanical Wave|mechanical waves]], do *not* require a medium to propagate. These waves have three primary characteristics: [[Wavelength|wavelength]], [[Frequency|frequency]], and [[Speed|speed]]. In an EM wave, the speed is always equal to the [[Speed of Light|speed of light]], $c$. The three concepts are related by the relationship,
$$
\lambda \nu=c
$$
Since wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional, we see that as we decrease in frequency along the [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|electromagnetic spectrum]], we increase in wavelength and vice versa.
# Energy of an EM wave
As postulated by [[Max Planck]], [[Energy|energy]] within an EM wave is [[Quantum Mechanics|quantized]] and can only be gained or lost in integer-multiples of the quantity $h\nu$.
$$
\Delta E=nh\nu
$$
where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
# Photoelectric effect
As discovered by [[Albert Einstein]], the photoelectric effect refers to the phenomenon in which [[Electron|electrons]] are emitted from the surface of a [[Metal|metal]] when [[Light|light]] strikes it. There are four main observations from this experiment:
1. Studies in which the frequency of the light is varied show that no electrons are emitted by a given metal below a specific threshold frequency, $\nu_{0}$.
2. For light with frequency less than the threshold frequency, no electrons are emitted regardless of the intensity of the light.
3. For light with frequency greater than the threshold frequency, the number of electrons emitted increases with the intensity of the light.
4. For light with frequency greater than the threshold frequency, the [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]] of the emitted electrons increases linearly with the frequency of the light.
These results are explained by making two key assumptions: 1) EM radiation is [[Quantum Mechanics|quantized]] and 2) the threshold frequency represents the minimum energy required to remove the electron from the metal's surface, $E_{0}$.
$$
E_{0}=h\nu_{0}
$$
Since a photon with energy less than $E_{0}$ ($\nu<\nu_{0}$) can not remove an electron, light with a frequency less than this threshold frequency produces no electrons. However, if the frequency is sufficient ($\nu>\nu_{0}$), the energy in excess of that required to remove the electron is given to the electron as kinetic energy.
$$
K_{\text{electron}}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=h\nu-h\nu_{0}=h(\Delta \nu)
$$
This result, when combined with [[Mass-Energy Equivalence|Einstein's mass-energy equivalence]] equation, $E=mc^2$, allows us to find the mass of both electrons and photons given that we can find their energies. We can extend this to any particle, not just photons and electrons, and find the wavelength of any particle with a [[Mass|mass]] $m$ and [[Velocity|velocity]] $v$.
$$
\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}
$$
This is known as [[de Broglie's Equation|de Broglie's equation]], and it allows us to find the wavelength of a particle.
