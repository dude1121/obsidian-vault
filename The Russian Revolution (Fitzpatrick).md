# 1 - The Setting
- In 1897 European Russia contained a population of about 92 million. 126 million including the rest of the empire. (p. 16)
- Handful of urban, industrial centres:
	- St. Petersburg, the capital
	- Moscow
	- Kiev
	- Kharkov
	- Odessa
	- Warsaw
	- Lodz
	- Riga
	- Rostov
	- Baku
- Rest of Russian towns were "sleepy backwaters" at the beginning of the 20th century (p. 17)
- In many villages the land was held communally
	- Allocation of land was handled by the *mir* (мир), the village council
	- Agriculture was still subsistence level
- Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, many former serfs still owed money to their former masters known as 'redemption' payments
	- This meant that now it was debt, not serfdom, that tied the peasants to the land
- Peasants were however able to work as seasonal workers in other fields, leaving their families for a season to work in construction, agriculture, or mining
	- These workers were known as *otkhodniki* (отходники) and were predominantly young men
	- This led to an increase in literacy in the otkhodniki with young men in less fertile regions being more likely to be literate than those in fertile regions (p. 18 - 19)
- Even within the large urban areas mentioned above, many workers lived in the villages and commuted to the cities to work
	- St. Petersburg seemed to be the only exception where workers lived with their families in the city
