A **harmonic** [[Frequency|frequency]] is an [[Integer|integer]] multiple of some given [[Fundamental Frequency|fundamental frequency]].  For example, a signal with a fundamental frequency of $60\pu{\! Hz}$ will have a first harmonic at $f_{1}=120\pu{ \! Hz}$, a second harmonic at $f_{2}=180\pu{\! Hz}$, a third at $f_{3}=240\pu{\! Hz}$, and so on. Each subsequent harmonic will have a fraction of the [[Amplitude|amplitude]] of the fundamental. A signal, with its fundamental frequency and total harmonics, can be represented as a [[Fourier Series|Fourier series]].
$$
v=a\sin \omega t+\frac{1}{2}a\sin 2\omega t+\frac{1}{3}\sin 3\omega t+\dots +\frac{1}{n}a\sin n\omega t+\dots
