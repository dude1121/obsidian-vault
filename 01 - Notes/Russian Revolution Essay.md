# Thesis
The Russian Revolution was betrayed by Lenin before Stalin came to power.
# Arguments
# 1. The Cheka
### First thoughts
- The Cheka was a precursor to the NKVD and KGB. It was a successor to the Okhrana.
- Secret police were used to root out "anti-revolutionary" activity including other socialists
	- Importantly though not fellow Bolsheviks. That idea is Stalin's.
### Research
- Cheka created in December 1917 (Fitzpatrick, 76)
	- All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Struggle against Counter-Revolution, Sabotage, and Speculation.
	- Originally created to "control the outbreak of banditry, looting, and raiding of liquor stores that followed the October seizure of power."
	- Became more of security police. "Soon assumed the broader functions of a security police, dealing with anti-regime conspiracies and keeping watch on groups whose loyalty was suspect, including bourgeois 'class enemies', officials of the old regime and Provisional Government, and members of the opposition political parties."
	- According to Bolshevik figures for twenty European Russian provinces, at least 8,389 were shot without trial by the Cheka and 87,000 were arrested.
#### The Okhrana
- Okhrana took over from the Third Section in 1881.
- Would intercept mail and read people's letters (Figes 124)
- One of those arrested and tortured by the Okhrana was [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]]. He rose to lead the Cheka and OGPU, he had spent much of his adult life in prison including a stint in the Orel Prison where he led hunger strike and was punished for it.
	- Figes notes that apparently his body was covered in scars from beatings in prison.
- Members of the Bolsheviks as well as other social democrats are suppressed after 1905 revolution by the Okhrana. Fewer than 1,000 Bolsheviks remained in Russia by 1910 due to mass arrests, police surveillance, and forced exiles of its leaders. (Figes, 210)
# 2. War Communism
- Admittedly I will need to do more research here but I know that Lenin's policies led to famine and a worsening of 
# 3. Reneging on promises of rights
