A **project** is a *temporary* and *one-time* endeavour. It is a sequence of unique, complex, and connected activities having one goal or purpose and it must be completed by a specific time, within budget, and according to the defined specification. This is in contrast to a [[Process|process]].

# Why are projects important?

Projects help companies overcome these challenges:

- Shortened product life cycles
- Narrow product launch windows
- Increasing complex and technical products
- Emergence of global markets
- An economic period marked by low inflation

The primary challenge of project management is to make sure a project is *delivered* within defined [[Constraint|constraints]]. The second, more ambitious goal is the *optimized* allocation and integration of resources needed to meet predefined objectives.

# Project Phases

1. ***Initiating*** - The manager must understand what it is they are trying to do and why they should do it.
	2. The PM must define a [[Business Case|business case]].
	3. Are there project [[Sponsor|sponsors]] available?
	4. Create the [[Project Charter|project charter]] and obtain sign off from all involved parties.
2. ***Planning*** - This is the stage that determines the ultimate success or failure of the project. The largest amount of work is done here to prepare the tools that will be used for the actual management of the project.
	1. Create the [[Project Scope|scope statement]]
	2. Create the [[Work Breakdown Structure|work breakdown structure (WBS)]]
	3. Create the [[Network Diagram|Network Diagram (AON)]]
	4. Create the [[Budget]]
	5. Create the [[Risk Assessment]] and Mitigation plans
	6. Determine quality standards
	7. Create the project control system
	8. Create the [[Project Communication|communication protocols]]
3. ***Executing / Controlling*** - In this stage, the PM transitions from being an active player to being an observer. Control must be maintained to ensure all tasks are completed on time, on budget, and meeting all quality requirements. [[Leadership]] qualities are most important in this phase. The *controlling* part of this stage involves daily reviewing scope and schedule control. 
4. ***Delivering***
5. ***Closing*** - Final reviews of budget, schedule, and scope are completed. Customer sign off is obtained and resources are returned to their home department.
	1. Create final project report
	2. Conduct lessons learned
	3. Obtain final payments and provide final payments for any contracted services.
