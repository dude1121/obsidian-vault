Still really bad at keeping a consistent schedule.

I had been trying to do this in the evenings but I've noticed there often is not a good time to do it, as for some reason this feels like a 'computer' activity and not a 'phone' activity, but I don't like using my computer in bed that often. I think instead I'll just do this when I have time and if it is consistently the same time each day then great but I don't care so much about that.

Last couple weeks, especially last week, have been a little tough. I've had no motivation to get schoolwork done and I also have a lot of data annotation to do in order to make rent. The bills just keep piling up and its getting harder to see how I'm going to make it work. Ocean has also missed some of her shifts the past couple weeks so we'll be missing that income. But I know she's been going through it as well so I can't blame her too much, just means I gotta work harder to keep up.

I wrote my electrical systems design test this morning, got a 91%. This is surprising considering last night I felt I was cooked.
