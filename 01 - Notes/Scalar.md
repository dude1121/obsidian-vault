A **scalar** quantity is a one-dimensional quantity. They are often accompanied by a [[Units of Measurement|unit of measurement]] in [[physics]] (e.g. $5\text{km}$). Scalars are comprised of only a magnitude and no direction, unlike a [[Vector|vector]] which has both magnitude and direction. 

A vector may be multiplied by a scalar in *scalar multiplication* (not to be confused with the *scalar product*, often called the [[Dot Product]]). For example, we can multiply some vector $\vec{a}$ by any scalar, $n$. The result is the magnitude of $\vec{a}$ grows by a factor of $n$, but the angle of $\vec{a}$ remains constant. We could break this into $\vec{a}$'s component parts,
$$
n \vec{a}=na_{x}+na_{y}\dots na_{N}
$$
Similarly, division by a scalar is the same as multiplying the vector by a factor of $\frac{1}{n}$.
