The **nucleus** is the centre of an [[Atom|atom]]. In almost all [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]] it contains both [[Proton|protons]] and [[Neutron|neutrons]]. When compared to the size of the atom as a whole, the nucleus is very small, however it makes up the majority of the mass of an atom since the orbiting [[Electron|electrons]] are nearly massless.
