A **mechanical wave** is one of the main types of waves (the other being [[Electromagnetic Radiation|electromagnetic]]). Like EM waves, mechanical waves are a form of [[Energy|energy]] transfer. All mechanical waves have three requirements:
1. Some source of disturbance
2. A medium containing elements that can be disturbed
3. Some physical mechanism through which elements of the medium can influence one another
# Types of waves
Mechanical waves can broadly be split into two main categories: *transverse waves* and *longitudinal waves*.
## Transverse waves
A transverse wave is a wave that causes the elements of the disturbed medium to move perpendicular to the direction of propagation. An example of this is moving a string that is fixed on one end up and down.
## Longitudinal waves
Longitudinal waves cause the elements of the disturbed medium to move parallel to the direction of propagation. An example of longitudinal wave motion are [[Sound Wave|sound waves]].
# Wave function
Imagine a pulse moving through some medium, like on a rope.

At any given time, the pulse can be described by some function we could write as $y(x,0)=f(x)$. Since the shape of the pulse remains constant (we assume no [[Dispersion|dispersion]]) we know that at any given time $t$ the shale of the pulse is the same as it was at $t=0$. If we say the pulse moves to the right with [[Velocity|velocity]] $v$, then the distance it travels in some time $t$ can be denoted as $vt$. From these two assumptions we can say that any given element of the string at $x$ at some new time $t$ has the same $y$ position as an element located at $x-vt$ had at $t=0$. That is,
$$
y(x,t)=y(x-vt,0)
$$
In general then we can represent the transverse position $y$ for all positions and times, measured in a stationary frame with the origin at $O$, as 
$$
y(x,t)=f(x-vt)
$$
If the pulse is instead moving to the left, the function is
$$
y(x,t)=f(x+vt)
$$
This function $y$ is called the *[[Wave Function|wave function]]*. This function represents the *y-coordinate*- the transverse position - of any element located at position $x$ at any time $t$. If the time $t$ is fixed, the function $y(x)$ (also known as the [[Waveform|waveform]]) defines a curve representing the geometric shape of the pulse at that time.
