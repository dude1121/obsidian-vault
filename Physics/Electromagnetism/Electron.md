An **electron** (commonly denoted as $e^{^-}$) is a subatomic particle that has a [[Charge|charge]] of $-1\ e$, where $e$ is the [[Elementary Charge]]. Electrons are an elementary particle, being both a [[Lepton|lepton]] and a [[Fermion|fermion]]. Electrons have an intrinsic [[Quantum Spin|spin]] of $1/2$. Electrons are also nearly massless, having approximately $1/1836$ the mass of a [[Proton|proton]].

Electrons give atoms their chemical properties. Since they carry charge, electrons also have their own [[electric field]]. Other [[Electromagnetic Field|electromagnetic fields]] will affect the motion of an electron, according to the [[Lorentz Force Law]].
