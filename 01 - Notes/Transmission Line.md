A **transmission line** is a means of transferring [[Energy|energy]] between [[Communication System|system]] elements that are carrying signal power. In essence, transmission lines are simply [[Wire|wires]], but at [[Radio|radio frequencies]] the conductors behave differently than at typical frequencies. For example, at high frequencies, the stray [[Inductance|inductances]] and [[Capacitance|capacitances]] that were negligible at low frequencies now become important. If the [[Impedance|impedances]] at either end of the transmission line are mismatched, then signals can be reflected back towards the source. This makes the concept of [[Impedance Matching|impedance matching]] very important in telecommunications.
