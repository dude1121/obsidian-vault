An **integral** is a continuous [[Summation|sum]]. It is more broadly defined as the "area under the curve", where the curve is the graph of some function. It is also the inverse operation of [[Derivative|differentiation]]. Integrals can either be *definite* or *indefinite*. 

# Definite Integration

Definite integrals have upper and lower bounds between which the function is integrated. These are called the "limits of integration". Definite integrals are defined as part of the [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus|fundamental theorem of calculus]] which relates differentiation and integration together.
