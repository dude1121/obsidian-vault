An **Atom** is a fundamental particle of all chemical [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]]. It consists of three basic particles: the [[Nucleus|nucleus]], made up of [[Proton|protons]] and [[Neutron|neutrons]], and [[Electron|electrons]], which are arranged into orbits around the nucleus. Atoms are electrically *neutral*, meaning they have a net [[Charge|charge]] of $0$. Atoms that differ only in their number of neutrons are called [[Isotope|isotopes]].

The idea of an "atom" was first speculated by Greek philosophers [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]]. Atom comes from the Greek work *atomos* which means 'not slice-able'. 
# Atomic Mass
The mass of an atom depends largely on the mass of the atom's nucleus, since electrons are nearly massless and do not contribute meaningfully to the total mass of the atom. The mass of the atom, often called the *atomic mass* or *atomic weight*, is therefore the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons. It is expressed in [[Atomic Mass Unit|atomic mass units]] $\pu{ u}$. Often this value is given as the *average atomic mass*, which is the average mass of all the atom's possible isotopes, each weighted according to how common that isotope is. For example, natural [[Carbon|carbon]] is composed of $98.89\% \ \ce{^12C}$ and $1.11\% \ \ce{^13C}$. Using the masses of $\ce{^12C}$ ($12\pu{ \! u}$ by definition) and $\ce{^13C}$ ($13.003355\pu{ \! u}$), we can find the average atomic mass for natural carbon.
$$
\begin{aligned}
m_{av}&=0.9889\cdot 12\pu{\! u} + 0.0111\cdot 13.003355\pu{ \! u}\\
&\approx 12.01\pu{\! u}
\end{aligned}
$$
## Moles
To more easily describe the mass of some sample of a compound or element, we use *moles* ($\pu{ mol}$). A mole is defined as the number of atoms in $12\pu{ \! g}$ of $\ce{^12C}$. This value is also known as [[Avogadro's Number|Avogadro's number]] and it is equal to:
$$
6.02214\times 10^{23}
$$
Avogadro's number gives us a conversion factor between the atomic mass unit $\pu{ u}$ and grams $\pu{ g}$. For example, if we have $1\pu{ \! mol}$ of [[Aluminum|aluminum]], the mass of aluminum is equal to its atomic mass value but in grams. I.e.,
$$
1\pu{ \! mol}_{Al}=6.022\times 10^{23} \cdot 26.982\pu{ \! u}=26.982\pu{ \! g}
$$
This also allows us to calculate how many atoms are in a given sample if we know both the mass of the sample and the average atomic mass of the element.
# Electron Shells
Each orbit has a corresponding energy level. These levels are designated 1, 2, 3, etc., with level 1 being the closest to the nucleus. These orbits are also known as "shells", which can all have varying amounts of electrons depending on their energy levels. The amount of electrons a given shell can hold is given by,
$$
N_{e}=2n^2
$$
where $N_{e}$ is the number of electrons and $n$ is the energy level of the shell.

The shell furthest from the nucleus is called the [[Valence Shell|valence shell]]. When a valence electron receives sufficient [[Energy|energy]] from an external source, it is able to break free from its orbit. The amount of energy required to do this is called the *[[Ionization Energy|ionization energy]]*.

Losing or gaining an electron is referred to as [[Ionization|ionization]]. When atoms lose electrons they become positively charged [[Ion|ions]] (cation) and when they gain electrons they become negatively charged ions (anions), since electrons are negatively [[Charge|charged]], and protons are positively charged. The escaped electron from a cation is called a *free electron*.
## The Quantum Model
Bohr's original model of the atom was a good approximation, but it is incorrect. The Quantum model is more accurate. Like Bohr's model, the quantum model has a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons. But the electrons are no longer in precise circular orbits. This is due to three important principles:
- [[Wave-Particle Duality]]. [[Elementary Particles|Elementary particles]] behave as both waves and particles. The velocity of an orbiting electron depends on its [[Wavelength|wavelength]] which in turn interferes with other nearby electrons.
- [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]]. Since a wave is not static and has peaks and valleys, electrons behaving as waves cannot be precisely identified in terms of their position. It is impossible to determine simultaneously both position & velocity of an electron with any degree of accuracy. Therefore, electrons are represented in probability clouds around the atom instead of precise circular orbits.
- [[Superposition Theorem (Quantum Mechanics)|Superposition]]. If the state of an object is unknown, it is said to be in all possible positions until it is observed.
In the quantum model, each shell consists of up to 4 subshells called [[Orbitals|orbitals]], denoted as $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$. (See [[Quantum Numbers|quantum numbers]])

Notation is as follows:

$1s^2\ \rightarrow$ 2 electrons in shell 1, orbital $s$
$2s^2\ 2p^3\ \rightarrow$ 5 electrons in shell 2, 2 in orbital $s$, and 3 in orbital $p$

Electrons fill these orbitals according to the [[Aufbau Principle|Aufbau principle]].
