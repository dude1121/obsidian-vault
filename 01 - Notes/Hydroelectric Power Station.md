A **hydroelectric power station** is a [[Power Systems|power generation station]] that uses the flow of [[Water|water]] to [[Generator|generate]] electricity. Hydroelectric power stations are typically located on rivers to take advantage of already moving water. These stations make up approximately $25\%$ of Ontario's power generation.

Water flows into the dam and is filtered by the *trash rack*. The water is then sent into the *penstock* where it is fed into a [[Turbine|turbine]]. This turbine spins when it is hit by the water, thereby generating a [[Voltage|voltage]] in the generator. This voltage is then stepped up by a [[Transformer|transformer]] where it is carried away by [[Transmission Line|transmission lines]]. The *control gate* can be raised or lowered to change the water flow. This change in water flow changes the [[Torque|torque]] applied on the turbine, thereby changing the [[Power|power]] output of the station. 

The power flow of this station begins with [[Potential Energy|potential energy]] of the water at the top of the penstock which is then converted into [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]] as it flows down the penstock. This kinetic energy is converted into [[Electrical Energy|electrical energy]] via the turbine and generator. 

The amount of electrical power generated is proportional to the [[Flow Rate|flow rate]] of the water, the height (or as its commonly referred to, *head*), and the [[Acceleration|acceleration]] due to [[Gravity|gravity]].
$$
P_{\text{e}}=Qgh
$$
where $Q$ is the flow rate of the water in $\pu{ kg/s}$ or $\pu{ m^3/s}$, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity $g=9.8\pu{ m/s^2 }$, and $h$ is the height of the water at the top of the penstock in $\pu{ m}$. If a flow rate is used using units of $\pu{ m^3/s}$, the power will be expressed in $\pu{ kW}$, not $\pu{ W}$ (since $1\pu{ m^3/s}=1000\pu{ kg/s}$).  Since power is simply the time derivative of energy, the power into a hydroelectric power station is the time derivative of the potential energy of the system (as flow rate is [[Mass|mass]] per time).
