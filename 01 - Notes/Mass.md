**Mass** is an intrinsic property of any given physical object. Mass can be described as a body's resistance to a change in its [[Velocity|velocity]] (i.e., its [[Acceleration|acceleration]]) when a given [[Force|force]] is applied (see [[Newton's Laws]]). According to the [[Law of Conservation of Mass]] mass can not be destroyed or created in a [[Chemical Reaction|chemical reaction]], however according to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[Mass-Energy Equivalence|mass-energy equivalence]], mass can be converted into [[Energy|energy]].

Mass is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Kilogram|kilograms]] $[\pu{ kg}]$.
