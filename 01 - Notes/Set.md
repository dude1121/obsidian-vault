A **set** in mathematics is any well-defined collection of objects called [[Element (Mathematics)|elements]]. In this context, well-defined means that it is possible to decide if a given object belongs to the set or not.

A set can be written as a list of elements surrounded in curly braces.
$$
\{1,2,3\}
$$
The order of the elements are not important, and repeated elements may be ignored. Therefore, the set
$$
\{2,3,1,1,3\}
$$
is equivalent to the set above it.

Typically uppercase letters denote sets and lowercase letters denote elements within a given set. An element is stated to be within a set by the notation,
$$
x \in A
$$
This is read as "x is an element of A". If $x$ is not an element in $A$, then we write
$$
x \notin A
$$
