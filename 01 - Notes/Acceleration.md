**Acceleration** is a change in an object's [[Velocity|velocity]] with respect to [[Time|time]]. Average acceleration is found by
$$
a_{av}=\frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$
As $\Delta t$ approaches $0$, we get closer to the instantaneous acceleration. This can be defined as the time [[Derivative|derivative]] of velocity, or the second derivative of [[Position|position]].
$$
\mathbf{\vec{a}}=\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{\vec{v}}=\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\mathbf{\vec{r}}
$$
Acceleration is a [[Vector|vector]] quantity and does not have a scalar counterpart. As given by [[Newton's Laws|Newton's second law]], acceleration is proportional to [[Force|force]].
$$
\mathbf{\vec{F}}\propto \mathbf{\vec{a}}
$$
