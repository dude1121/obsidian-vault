The **Law of Multiple Proportions** is a law in chemistry that states,

>[!quote] Law of Multiple Proportions
>When two [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]] form a series of [[Compound|compounds]], the ratios of the [[Mass|masses]] of the second element that combine with $1\pu{ g}$ of the first element can always be reduced to small whole numbers.

In other words, all compounds must have whole numbers of [[Atom|atoms]] that make them up; fractional elements are not allowed. This law was described by English chemist [[John Dalton]].
