**Energy** is an object's capacity to do [[Work|work]]. It is measured in [[Joule|joules]] $[\pu{ J}]$. Similar to [[Momentum|momentum]], energy is a [[Law of Conservation of Energy|conserved]] quantity, meaning it can not be created or destroyed. 

# Forms of Energy

Energy comes in various forms:
- [[Electrical Energy|Electrical energy]]
- [[Magnetic Energy|Magnetic energy]]
- [[Elastic Energy|Elastic energy]]
- [[Chemical Energy|Chemical energy]]
- [[Radiant Energy|Radiant energy]]
- [[Internal Energy|Internal energy]]
- [[Rest Energy|Rest energy]]
All of these forms are really due to either [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]], [[Potential Energy|potential energy]], or some combination of the two. For example, electric energy is really just potential energy stored in [[Electric Field|electric fields]].  These forms can be converted between one another by some form of *energy transfer*.
