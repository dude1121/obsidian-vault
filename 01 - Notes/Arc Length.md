**Arc length** is the distance a rotating object travels as it rotates. Typically it is denoted with $s$ and [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Metre|metres]] $[\text{m}]$. It is defined as,
$$
s=r\theta
$$
where $r$ is the [[Radius|radius]], or [[Distance|distance]] from the [[Origin|origin]] to some point $P$, and $\theta$ is the [[Angular Position|angle]] that the ray $r$ makes with the horizontal axis, also known as the *angular displacement*.
