A **current source** is anything that provides [[Current|current]] to an electrical circuit. It, like a [[Voltage Sources|voltage source]] may be in the form of either [[DC Electricity|dc]] or [[AC Electricity|ac]], however the symbol for a dc and ac current source is identical. While in reality there is no such thing as a purely independent current source, it is sometimes useful to model a circuit as having an independent current source instead of a voltage source via a [[Source Conversion|source conversion]] for circuit analysis purposes.

The symbol for a dc or ac current source is typically an arrow indicating the direction of current flow surrounded by a circle. Note that the total circuit current, typically denoted as $I_T$, is now marked as $I_{S1}$ since the current source is the same as the total circuit current. The voltage across the source has now changed, however, to $E_{IS1}$. 

# Independent and Dependent Sources

Much like voltage sources, current sources can be either independent or dependent. In fact, in reality most current sources are dependent. An example would be a [[Field Effect Transistor|FET transistor]] that is current controlled and acts as a current source.
