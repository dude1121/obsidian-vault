In [[Statistics|statistics]], **data** consists of information coming from observations, counts, measurements, or responses. Data is often organized into *data sets* which themselves come in two forms: *qualitative* data and *quantitative* data. 

- Qualitative data consists of attributes, labels, or nonnumerical entries
- Quantitative data consists of numbers that are measurements or counts

Another way to characterize data sets is their *level of measurement*.
