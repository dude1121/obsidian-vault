# Summary
- *2*. Once again, [[Abraham]] says [[Sarah]] is his sister, not wife.
- *3*. Once again, God threatens to kill the King taking Sarah not knowing that she is Abraham's wife.
- *4 - 5*. [[Abimelech]], unlike [[Pharaoh]], actually communicates with God about this.
- *7*. God says that if Sarah is returned then Abimelech will live.
	- This is the first time the word '[[Prophet|prophet]]' is used in the Bible.
- *9*. Abimelech confronts Abraham about lying to him.
- *12*. Sarah confirmed as Abraham's half-sister.
- *14*. To avoid God's curse, Abimelech sends Abraham on his way and gives him slaves, sheep, and oxen.
- *15 - 16*. Abimelech also gives 1000 pieces of silver and allows them to settle wherever they want in his land.
# Thoughts
This account parallels much of the account in Egypt except that the ruler, in this case Abimelech of Gerar, is portrayed in much more positive light.

Still seems odd to me that God would stand behind Abraham's constant deception. If Abraham did this, as many JW publications claim, to protect the seed that God had promised, why wouldn't Abraham trust God's promise to deliver him?
