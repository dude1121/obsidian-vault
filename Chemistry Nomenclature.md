**Chemistry nomenclature** refers to the rules regarding naming chemical [[Compound|compounds]].
# Binary compounds
### Type I: Ionic Compounds
Binary ionic compounds contain a positive [[Ion|ion]] (cation) always written first in the formula and a negative ion (anion). The following rules apply to these compounds:

>[!note] Naming Type I Binary Compounds
>1. The cation is always named first and the anion second
>2. A monatomic cation takes its name from the name of the element. For example, $\ce{Na+}$ is called '[[Sodium|sodium]]' in the names of compounds containing this ion
>3. A monatomic anion is named by taking the root of the element name and adding '-ide'. Thus the  $\ce{Cl-}$ ion is called '[[Chlorine|chloride]]'.

For example, 
- $\ce{NaCl}\to$ [[Sodium Chloride|sodium chloride]]
- $\ce{CaS}\ \to$ [[Calcium Sulfide|calcium sulfide]]
- $\ce{Li_{3}N}\ \to$ [[Lithium Nitride|lithium nitride]]
Note that it does not matter how *many* ions are in the compound.
### Type II Ionic Compounds
Some metals can form more than just one type of ion. In this case, the charge on the ion must be specified. In an older system sometimes still encountered, when an [[Atom|atom]] has two different types of ions it can form, the ion with the higher charge has a name ending in '-ic' and the one with the lower charge has a name ending in '-ous'. For example, $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$ is called the *ferric ion* and $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ is the *ferrous ion*. 

>[!note] Naming Type II Binary Compounds
>1. The cation is always named first and the anion second.
>2. A monatomic cation takes its name from the name of the element along with the [[Charge|charge]] of the cation, noted in [[Roman Numerals|roman numerals]].
>3. A monatomic anion is named in the same manner as Type I compounds.

For example,
- $\ce{CuCl}\ \to$ [[Copper (I) Chloride|copper (I) chloride]] or cuprous chloride
- $\ce{HgO}\ \to$ [[Mercury (II) Oxide|mercury (II) oxide]]
- $\ce{Fe_{2}O_{3}}\ \to$ [[Iron (III) Oxide|iron (III) oxide]] or ferric oxide

Some exceptions to this rule are [[Aluminum|aluminum]], [[Silver|silver]], and [[Zinc|zinc]]. Aluminum only forms $3+$ ions and therefore does not need its charge specified. Zinc is much the same, forming only $2+$ ions. Silver technically can form more than one ion but in virtually all compounds silver is found in the $\ce{Ag+}$ ion, so its charge is also rarely specified.
#### Side Note: Ionic Compounds with Polyatomic Ions
[[Polyatomic Ion|Polyatomic ions]] are special ions that have their own unique names that do not match the rules above. Many polyatomic ions contain some element with various amounts of [[Oxygen|oxygen]] atoms. These are called *oxyanions*. The prefix and suffix on the oxyanion tells us how [[Oxidation State|oxidized]] it is. 

| Prefix / Suffix | Oxidation |
| --------------- | --------- |
| hypo-           | $1+$      |
| -ite            | $3+$      |
| -ate            | $5+$      |
| per-            | $7+$      |
Ionic compounds with polyatomic ions are named following the same rules as above for either Type I or Type II, depending on the cation. 

For example,
- $\ce{Na_{2}SO_{4}}\ \to$ [[Sodium Sulfate|sodium sulfate]]
- $\ce{Mn(OH)2}\ \to$ [[Manganese (II) Hydroxide|Manganese (II) hydroxide]] or manganous hydroxide
- $\ce{Fe(NO_{3})3}\ \to$ [[Iron (III) Nitrate|iron (III) nitrate]] or ferric nitrate
### Type III: Covalent Compounds
Binary covalent compounds are formed between two [[Non-Metals|nonmetals]]. 
>[!note] Naming Binary Covalent Compounds
>1. The first element in the formula is named first, using the full element name.
>2. The second element is named as if it were an anion.
>3. Prefixes are used to denote the number of atoms present.
>4. The prefix 'mono-' is never used for naming the first element. For example, $\ce{CO}$ is called [[Carbon Monoxide|carbon monoxide]] not monocarbon monoxide.

The table below shows what prefix refers to what number.

| Prefix | Number indicated |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| mono-  | 1                |
| di-    | 2                |
| tri-   | 3                |
| tetra- | 4                |
| penta- | 5                |
| hexa-  | 6                |
| hepta- | 7                |
| octa-  | 8                |
| nona-  | 9                |
| deca-  | 10               |
If the element begins with a vowel, the vowel from the prefix is typically dropped to ease with pronunciation. $\ce{N_{2}O_{4}}$ is [[Dinitrogen Tetroxide|dinitrogen tetroxide]] not dinitrogen tetraoxide. Some covalent compouds are instead always referred to by their common names. As an example, $\ce{H_{2}O}$ is always [[Water|water]] and never dihydrogen monoxide. Same goes for [[Ammonia|ammonia]] $\ce{NH_{3}}$ and [[Hydrogen Peroxide|hydrogen peroxide]] $\ce{H_{2}O_{2}}$.

For example,
- $\ce{O_{2}F_{2}}\ \to$ [[Dioxygen difluoride|dioxygen difluoride]]
- $\ce{PCl_{5}}\ \to$ [[Phosphorus Pentachloride|phosphorus pentachloride]]
- $\ce{SO_{3}}\ \to$ [[Sulfur Trioxide|sulfur trioxide]]
### Acids
[[Acid|Acids]] are named differently than other compounds. An acid can be identified from its formula typically if it is an [[Ionic Compound|ionic compound]] and if the cation in that compound is [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]].
>[!note] Naming Acids
>1. If the name of the anion ends in '-ide', the acid is named with the prefix 'hydro-' and the suffix '-ic'. For example, hydrogen chloride $\ce{HCl}$ when dissolved in water becomes [[Hydrochloric Acid|hydrochloric acid]]. 
>2. If the anion name ends in '-ate', the suffix '-ic' is added to the root name. $\ce{H_{2}SO_{4}}$ contains sulfate and is thus called [[Sulfuric Acid|sulfuric acid]].
>3. If the anion name ends in '-ite', the '-ite' is replaced with '-ous'. $\ce{H_{2}SO_{3}}$ contains sulfite and is thus called [[Sulfurous Acid|sulfurous acid]]. 

Some names of common acids are shown below.

| Acid Formula | Name                                     | Acid Formula            | Name                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| $\ce{HF}$    | [[Hydrofluoric Acid\|hydrofluoric acid]] | $\ce{HNO_{3}}$          | [[Nitric Acid\|nitric acid]]           |
| $\ce{HCl}$   | hydrochloric acid                        | $\ce{HNO_{2}}$          | [[Nitrous Acid\|nitrous acid]]         |
| $\ce{HBr}$   | [[Hydrobromic Acid\|hydrobromic acid]]   | $\ce{H_{3}PO_{4}}$      | [[Phosphoric Acid\|phosphoric acid]]   |
| $\ce{HCN}$   | [[Hydrocyanic Acid\|hydrocyanic acid]]   | $\ce{HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}}$ | [[Acetic Acid\|acetic acid]] (vinegar) |
