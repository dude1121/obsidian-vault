# Smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms
## 32-200 Installation of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms in dwelling units
> 1) The following requirements shall apply to the installation of permanently connected smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms in dwelling units: 
> 	a) smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms shall be supplied from a lighting circuit, or from a circuit that supplies a mix of lighting and receptacles;
> 	b) smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms, or a device that is a combination of a smoke alarm and a carbon monoxide alarm shall not be installed where the circuit is protected by a ground fault circuit interrupter or an arc-fault circuit interrupter;
> 	c) there shall be no disconnecting means between the smoke alarm or the carbon monoxide alarm and the overcurrent device for the branch circuit; and
> 	d) the wiring method for smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, including any interconnection of units and their associated equipment, shall be in accordance with [[CEC s.12|Section 12]].
> 2) Notwithstanding Subrule 1) b), where a smoke alarm, carbon monoxide alarm, or a device that is a combination of a smoke alarm and a carbon monoxide alarm has an integral battery as a secondary supply source, such an alarm or device shall be permitted to be connected to a circuit protected by a ground fault circuit interrupter or an arc-fault circuit interrupter.

Appendix B notes that permanently connected smoke and carbon monoxide alarms are considered life safety devices under the *National Building Code of Canada*, and their wiring—including interconnection using a Class 2 power supply—must comply with [[CEC s.12|Section 12]]; it also clarifies that Class 2 circuit conductors described in [[CEC s.16|Rule 16-210]] are not permitted for such interconnections. While smoke alarms are required to be hardwired, carbon monoxide alarms may be either hardwired or battery-powered. The appendix further specifies that $120\ \mathrm{V}$ alarms meeting CAN/ULC-S531 (for smoke) or CSA 6.19 (for CO) should be installed on branch circuits supplying lighting or a combination of lighting and receptacles in each dwelling unit and in sleeping rooms located outside dwelling units. Further, while Subrule 1) a) states that these alarms can be installed on lighting / receptacle circuits, Appendix B notes that they **can not** be installed on a circuit with *only* receptacles.

From Appendix G, see sections 3.2.4.20. and 9.10.19.4. in the *National Building Code of Canada* for smoke alarms and sections 6.9.3.1. and 9.32.3.9. for carbon monoxide alarms.
