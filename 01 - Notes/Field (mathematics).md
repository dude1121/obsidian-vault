A **field** a [[Set|set]] in which four operations ([[Addition|addition]], [[Subtraction|subtraction]], [[Multiplication|multiplication]], and [[Division|division]]) can be defined so that, with the exception of division by zero, the sum, product, difference, and quotient of any two [[Element (Mathematics)|elements]] in the set is also an element of the set.[^1]

More precisely, a field $F$ is a set on which two operations $+$ and $\cdot$ (called **addition** and **multiplication**, respectively) are defined so that, for each pair of elements $x$, $y$ in $F$, there are unique elements $x+y$ and $x\cdot y$ in $F$ for which the following conditions hold for all elements $a$, $b$, $c$ in $F$.

1) $a+b=b+a$ and $a\cdot b=b\cdot a$ ([[Commutative Property|commutativity]] of addition and multiplication)
2) $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ and $(a\cdot b)\cdot c=a\cdot(b\cdot c)$ ([[Associative Property|associativity]] of addition and multiplication)
3) There exist distinct elements $0$ and $1$ in $F$ such that $0+a=a$ and $1\cdot a=a$ (existence of identity elements for addition and multiplication)
4) For each element $a$ in $F$ and each nonzero element $b$ in $F$, there exist elements $c$ and $d$ such that $a+c=0$ and $b\cdot d=1$ (existence of inverses for addition and multiplication)
5) $a\cdot(b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c$ (distributivity of multiplication over addition)
