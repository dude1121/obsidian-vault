**Nuclear binding energy** is difference between the [[Rest Energy|rest energy]] of the [[Nucleus|nucleus]] and the combined rest energy of the separated [[Nucleon|nucleons]]. In other words, the binding energy is the the amount of energy that must be added to a nucleus to break it apart into its components. The binding energy can be found by,
$$
E_{b}=[ZM(H)+Nm_{n}-M(\ce{_{Z}^AX})]\times 931.494\pu{\! MeV/u }
$$
where $Z$ is the [[Atomic Number|atomic number]] of the atom under consideration, $M(H)$ is the mass of a neutral [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] atom, $N$ is the number of [[Neutron|neutrons]] in the nucleus, $m_{n}$ is the mass of a neutron, and $M(\ce{_{Z}^AX})$ is the atomic mass of the isotope $\ce{_{Z}^AX}$. All masses are given in [[Atomic Mass Unit|atomic mass units]] $[\pu{ u}]$.

The plot for various binding energy per particle vs. mass number is shown above. What becomes evident is that at around $A=60$ there is a region of stability where the binding energy is the greatest. The decrease in binding energy per nucleon for $A>60$ implies that energy is *released* when a heavy nucleus splits (see [[Nuclear Fission|fission]]) into two lighter nuclei. Energy is released because the nucleons in each product nucleus are more tightly bound to one another than the nucleons in the original nucleus.
