**Density** is a substance's [[Mass|mass]] per unit [[Volume|volume]]. It is most often denoted as $\rho$, although sometimes $D$ is used. It is defined mathematically as,
$$
\rho=\frac{m}{V}
$$
where $\rho$ is the density in [[Kilogram|kilograms]] per cubic [[Metre|metre]] $[\pu{ kg/m^3}]$. 

The density of a material varies with [[Temperature|temperature]] and [[Pressure|pressure]]. This variation is typically negligible for [[Solid|solids]] and [[Liquid|liquids]] but is more prevalent in [[Gas|gases]]. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases its volume and therefore increases its density. Conversely, increasing an object's temperature increases its volume, causing its density to decrease.
