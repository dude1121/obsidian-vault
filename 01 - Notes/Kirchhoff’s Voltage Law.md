Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, named for German physicist and mathematician Gustav Kirchhoff, is also known as **Kirchhoff's Second Law**, with [[Kirchhoff's Current Law]] being the first law. It states:

> The sum of the potential differences ([[Voltage|voltages]]) around any closed loop is zero.

Put algebraically,
$$
	\sum_{i=1}^nv_i=0\text{V}
$$
where $n$ is the number of voltages measured in the loop. Note that this loop does not need to be a physical loop comprised on components and conductors. "Imaginary" loops can be drawn in a circuit and KVL will still be satisfied.
