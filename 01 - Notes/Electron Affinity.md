**Electron affinity** is defined as the amount of [[Energy|energy]] released when an [[Electron|electron]] attaches to a neutral [[Atom|atom]] or [[Molecule|molecule]] in the [[Gas|gaseous]] state to form an [[Ion|anion]].
$$
\ce{X(g) + e- -> X-(g) + energy}
$$
Electron affinity is positive when energy is released on electron capture. It is typically denoted as $E_{\text{ea}}$ and can be measured in either [[Electron Volts|electron volts]] $[\pu{ eV}]$ or kilo[[Joule|joules]] per [[Mole|mole]] $[\pu{ kJ/mol}]$. 
# Periodic trends
In general, electron affinity increases from left-to-right in a [[Periodic Table|period]] and decreases from top-to-bottom within a group. For example, the bottom left-most element [[Francium|francium]] has an electron affinity of $46.89\ \pu{ kJ/mol}$ where as the top-right most non-noble gas element [[Fluorine|fluorine]] has an electron affinity of $328.1649\ \pu{ kJ/mol}$. There are exceptions to this trend, however.

All [[Noble Gas|noble gases]] have a negative electron affinity, meaning there is no energy released when an electron is attached to them, making the reaction [[Endothermic Process|endothermic]]. [[Beryllium]], [[Magnesium|magnesium]], and [[Nitrogen|nitrogen]] also have negative electron affinities, with nitrogen being especially interesting. In fact, all [[Pnictogens|pnictogens]] except for [[Bismuth|bismuth]] have lower electron affinities than their neighbours.
