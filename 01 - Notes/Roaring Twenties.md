The **roaring twenties** refer to the period spanning from 1920 - 1929 which in many Western nations saw great economic growth and a rise in the quality of life for the upper and middle classes. 
# The 'good'
In the United States, we see several large increases from 1922 to 1929:
- Industrial Production increased 70%
- The Gross National Product (GNP) increased 40%
- Per Capita income increased 30%
- Output per factory man hour increased 75%
- Corporate profits (1923-1929) increased 62%
A large share of these profit increases were due to the rise of the automobile.

The Model T (pictured above) was incredibly popular. In 1921 Ford produced 1 million units.

The Ford brand was so trusted that when the Model A was announced in 1928, 500,000 Americans made a down payment on the car without having seen it or even knowing its cost.

Advertising becomes incredibly prominent at this time, marketing consumer goods so that people feel they "need" to have them. In America, we saw the rise of war bonds and many industries were converted to munitions factories during WWI. After the war, these were no longer required and the patriotic act became to *spend*.

A self-perpetuating cycle began to emerge where mass production led to better machinery in factories, which led to higher production and higher wages, which led to more demand for consumer goods.
1. Mass production gives way to mass consumption
2. Advertising becomes a staple of the modern economy
3. Needs-based economy transitions to wants-based economy
4. Americans buy on credit to get what they want, when they want it.
# The bad
Ideologies like nativism, ethnocentrism, racism, and isolationism become very prominent.
## Economy
In the 1920s the following statistics were present in the USA:
- American families with no savings: 80%
- Percentage of savings held by top 1% of Americans: 34%
- Percentage of savings held by top 2.3% of Americans: 67%
- Minimum income deemed necessary for a decent family standard of living: $2500
- American families with incomes under $2500 in 1929: 71%
## The KKK
The KKK is originally founded in the South following the US Civil War. The first KKK was prevalent in the South for a period of time after the war. They sought to preserve the 'Southern way of life.' The KKK was responsible for lynchings in the south of African-Americans, but was driven underground.

In the 1910s and 20s, the KKK returned, this time in the more well-known white cloaks and featuring cross-burning. *The Birth of a Nation* was a popular film in 1915 that really drove the KKK resurgence. It was one of the first feature-length films in America. [[Woodrow Wilson]] said that the film was not only historically accurate but like "history writ with lightning." 

The new KKK was much more violent and vocal. Their enemies now included Asians, immigrants, bootleggers, night clubs, road houses, those violating the Sabbath, sex both pre- and extra-marital, and 'scandalous behaviour.' By the summer of 1921, the KKK boasted nearly 100,000 members (charging $10/head, tax-free of course). 
## The First Red Scare
After WWI, America was afraid of Communism and left-wing ideologies in general. An early example of this is the Sacco-Vanzetti case.

Innocent people were arrested for expressing their views, civil liberties were ignored, and many Americans feared that a Bolshevik-style revolution was imminent.

Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were controversially accused and convicted of murdering a guard and paymaster during an armed robbery. The evidence was largely circumstantial but the two were convicted regardless and sent to the electric chair in 1927.
# Anti-immigration and Isolationism
Two important acts are passed in the USA at this time.
1. Emergency Immigration Act, 1921
   Restricted new arrivals to 3% of the foreign born of a nationality.
2. National Origins Act, 1924
   Limited number of people from any nationality to 2% the total number of the national origin living in the USA in 1890.
These laws also capped immigrants per year at 150,000. These laws virtually ended immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe and excluded Asians almost entirely. In Canada, all Chinese immigrants are barred from entering Canada in 1923.
# Cultural conservatism and the Scopes Trial
The Scopes Trial saw a schoolteacher, John T. Scopes, be put on trial in Dayton, Tennessee for teaching [[Theory of Evolution|evolution]] in the classroom. Tennessee was particularly fundamentalist, much like many of its neighbouring states. Ultimately, Scopes is convicted and fined $100, however [[Christian Fundamentalism]] is put on trial as well and loses a lot of support in America at large.
