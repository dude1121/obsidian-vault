**Velocity** is the change in an object's [[Position|position]] with respect to [[Time|time]]. Put another way, velocity is an object's [[Displacement|displacement]] over time. This also makes velocity the time [[Derivative|derivative]] of position.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{v}}=\frac{\mathbf{\vec{d}}}{t}=\frac{d\mathbf{\vec{r}}}{dt}
$$
If the time is not an infinitesimal quantity and instead is some range, the velocity over this period is the *average* velocity, not the *instantaneous* velocity. If the velocity varies with time, this variation is called the object's [[Acceleration|acceleration]]. That is, acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and velocity is the [[Integral|integral]] of acceleration.
$$
\mathbf{\vec{a}}=\frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{\vec{v}}
$$
$$
\mathbf{\vec{v}}=\int \mathbf{\vec{a}}\ dt
$$As noted with the boldface and arrows above $\mathbf{v}$, velocity is a [[Vector|vector]]. Its scalar counterpart is [[Speed|speed]]. Velocity is measured in [[Metre|metres]] per [[Second|second]] $[\pu{ m/s}]$.
