[[Genesis 17|Previous]] [[Genesis 19|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. [[Yahweh]] appears to [[Abraham]].
- *2*. God appears as three men.
- *4 - 5*. Abraham gets food and water for the men.
- *10*. One of the men says that Sarah will be pregnant and have a son.
- *12*. Sarah laughs at this idea.
	- Her eventual son's name, [[Isaac]], means 'he \[God] laughs' (Isaac, יצחק; to laugh, צחק)
- *15*. After being rebuked, Sarah denies laughing.
- *16 - 20*. God tells Abraham what he intends to do about [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].
- *22 - 33*. Abraham tries to argue with God about destroying these cities. Abraham gets God to agree that if he finds even 10 loyal people, he (God) will not destroy the cities.
# Thoughts
Abraham is depicted as being hospitable and reasonable. Sarah though laughs at God for saying she will conceive. When confronted, Sarah then lies about it. Seems like Abraham and Sarah got by lying to many people...

Abraham tries to convince God not to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. Why, though, does God specifically want to destroy these cities? There undoubtedly were other "wicked" cities surrounding the area. The Sumerians and Egyptians, for instance, were both "pagan" nations that didn't serve Yahweh. Why didn't he destroy them?
