The **wavelength** of a wave (either [[Mechanical Wave|mechanical]] or [[Electromagnetic Radiation|electromagnetic]]) is the physical [[Distance|distance]] between consecutive points (typically measured from peak-to-peak or trough-to-trough) in the wave. It is usually measured in [[Metre|metres]] $[\pu{ m}]$ and denoted with $\lambda$. 

Wavelength is related to the wave [[Speed|speed]] and [[Frequency|frequency]] by the relationship
$$
\lambda=\frac{v}{f}
$$
Since EM waves always travel at the [[Speed of Light|speed of light]], a special case of this relationship arises,
$$
\lambda f=c
$$
