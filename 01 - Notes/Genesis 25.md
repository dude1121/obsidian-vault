[[Genesis 24|Previous]] [[Genesis 26|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 6*. [[Abraham]] marries another woman named [[Keturah]] and through her has six sons, who themselves have their own children. He sends all his children, less [[Isaac]], "eastward to the east country."
- *7 - 8*. Abraham dies at 175 in 2123 after Adam (see timeline [[Genesis 11|here]]).
- *9*. Abraham is buried by Isaac and [[Ishmael]] in the same cave [[Sarah]] is buried in, Machpelah.
- *11*. Isaac settles at Beer-lahai-roi (this is the same place that Hagar spoke with God in [[Genesis 16]]).
- *12 - 15*. Ishmael's 12 children are listed here. See [[Genesis 17]].
- *17*. Ishmael dies at 137 in 2171 AA.
- *20*. Isaac is 40 when he marries Rebekah (this would therefore occur in 2088 AA).
- *21*. Rebekah, like Sarah, is barren. Isaac prays and Rebekah then conceives.
>[!quote] Genesis 25.23
> And the LORD said to her, 'Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger.'

> - [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]

- *23*. Rebekah is pregnant with twins. God prophecies that they will be two struggling nations with the elder serving the younger.
- *25*. [[Esau]] is born red and hairy. 
	- The Hebrew word for 'red' or 'reddish' ('admoni' אדמוני) is a play on the word 'Edom' (אדום) and the word for 'hairy' ("se'ar" שעיר) is a play on the name Seir, the region in which the [[Edomites]] lived.
- *26*. [[Jacob]] is born gripping Esau's heel.
	- The Hebrew word for 'heel' ('akev' עקב) is similar to the name 'Jacob' ("ya'aqob" יעקב)
	- Isaac is said to be 60 when the twins are born, meaning this happens in 2108 AA.
- *27 - 28*. Esau is a man of the field and Jacob is quiet. Isaac loved Esau and Rebekah loved Jacob. This plays on the same dynamic seen between [[Cain]] and [[Abel]], with Cain being more like Esau and Abel more like Jacob.
- *30*. Esau asks for some 'red' stew, once again more wordplay related to his name.
- *31 - 34*. Esau sells the birthright for a bowl of stew.
	- This caricature of Esau being dumb, only caring about food, is likely meant to explain [[Ancient Israel|Israel]]'s domination over Edom.
# Thoughts
There is a lot of foreshadowing to struggles between Israel and Edom. The meaning behind the names Esau and Jacob is also interesting and probably isn't known to many reading only in English.

The story of Jacob and Esau parallels that of Cain and Abel. The older brother despises the important values. This time though, the younger is successful in obtaining the blessing. In essence, Israel is symbolically Abel's descendant, i.e. righteous.
