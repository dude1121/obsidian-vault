**Project communication** involves all the processes that are required to ensure timely and appropriate communication of [[Project|project]] information. These processes include 1) *Plan Communications management*, 2) *Manage communications*, and 3) *Control communications*. Project communication can be in-person or digital. The more people / branches involved in a project, the more lines of communication exist. A general formula for the number of possible interactions is
$$
N=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}
$$
where $N$ is the number of interactions and $n$ is the number of people / branches. 90% of the time a project manager spends on a project will be spent communicating.

# 3 Elements of communication
The three elements of all communications are the *sender*, the *receiver*, and the *message*.
