**Kinetic energy** is a form of [[Energy|energy]] that an object possesses while it is in [[Motion|motion]]. As a form of energy, it is measured in [[Joule|joules]] $[\pu{ J}]$. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other forms of energy. For non-rotating objects, kinetic energy is given by
$$
K=\frac{1}{2}m\mathbf{\vec{v}}^2
$$
where $\mathbf{\vec{v}}$ is the [[Velocity|velocity]] of the object and $m$ is its [[Mass|mass]]. If the body is rotating, then the rotational kinetic energy is given by,
$$
K_{r}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2
$$
where $\omega$ is the object's [[Angular Velocity|angular velocity]] and $I$ is the object's [[Moment of Inertia|moment of inertia]]. In [[Relativity|relativity]], these equations hold if the velocity is much less than the speed of light.
