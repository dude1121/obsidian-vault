In kinematics, a **rigid body** is a hypothetical object that is nondeformable. All real objects are [[Elasticity in Solids|deformable]] to some extent, but the rigid body model is useful where this deformation is negligible.  This model is used extensively in modeling *rotational* motion and for calculating [[Moment of Inertia|moments of inertia]].
