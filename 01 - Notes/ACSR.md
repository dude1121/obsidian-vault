**ACSR** (standing for **a**luminum **c**onductor **s**teel **r**einforced) is a type of [[Conductor|conductor]] that is specially designed for [[Transmission Line#High voltage transmission lines|overhead high voltage lines]]. It is a stranded conductor, consisting of aluminum strands with steel strands at the core to give the conductor strength.

[[Aluminum]] is typically used rather than [[Copper|copper]] since copper is more expensive than aluminum and copper is heavier than aluminum. This makes aluminum a much more economical choice. Still, ACSR has a very high conductivity due to the high-purity aluminum in its strands.

The steel allows this conductor to support more weight from wind or ice loading, as well as it does not expand as much due to heating increases from the current through the conductor.
