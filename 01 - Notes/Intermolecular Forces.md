**Intermolecular forces** are forces present within a substance due to the [[Polar Molecule|polarity]] of the [[Molecule|molecules]] in that substance. There are three main types of intermolecular forces: *London dispersion*, *dipole-dipole*, and *hydrogen bonding*.
# London dispersion
London dispersion forces are forces present between molecules that are nonpolar or noble gases. Even though these molecules are nonpolar, as the [[Electron|electrons]] move about the [[Nucleus|nucleus]], a momentary nonsymmetrical electron distribution can develop that produces a temporary dipolar arrangement of [[Charge|charge]]. This can, in turn, affect the electron distribution of a neighbouring [[Atom|atom]]. This *instantaneous* dipole can induce a similar dipole in a neighbouring atom. This leads to an interatomic attraction that is relatively weak and short-lived but can be very significant especially for large atoms.

In order for these forces to be strong enough to produce a solid, the motions of the atoms must be greatly slowed down which is why molecules attracted solely by London dispersion forces typically have much lower [[Freezing Point|freezing points]].
