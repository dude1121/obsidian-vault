A **transistor** is a [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]] device that can either [[Amplification|amplify]] or switch electrical signals. Typically a transistor consists of 3 terminals, with one of the terminals controlling the [[Voltage|voltage]] across or [[Current|current]] through the other two terminals.

Transistors form the building blocks of all modern electronics and are crucial for computing. 
# History
The first transistor was conceived of in 1925 by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] but at the time these devices could not be constructed. The first transistor that was operational was a [[Point-contact transistor|point-contact transistor]] demonstrated by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]] in 1947. This won them the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1956. Shockley went on to develop the first [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar junction transistor]] a year later in 1948.
# Transistor Types
The most commonly used kind of transistor is a [[Field Effect Transistor|Field Effect Transistor]] (FET), specifically [[Metal Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor|Metal Oxide Semiconductor FETs]] (MOSFETs). Related to MOSFETs are [[Junction Field Effect Transistor|junction field effect transistors]] (JFETs). The most common non-FET transistor is the [[Bipolar junction transistor|Bipolar Junction Transistor]] (BJT).
