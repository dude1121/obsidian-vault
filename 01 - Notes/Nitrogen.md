**Nitrogen** is an [[Element (Chemistry)|element]] with symbol **N** and [[Atomic Number|atomic number]] 7. It is a [[Gas|gas]] at room temperature. At standard temperature, two nitrogen [[Atom|atoms]] bond to form $\text{N}_{2}$. This compound forms the majority of [[Earth]]'s [[Atmosphere|atmosphere]] (~$78\%$). Nitrogen is a [[Non-Metals|nonmetal]] and is in the group known as the [[Pnictogens|pnictogens]].

# Isotopes
Nitrogen exists naturally in three isotopes with $\ce{^14N}$ being by far the most prevalent. $\ce{^14N}$ and $\ce{^15N}$ are both stable isotopes, whereas $\ce{^13N}$ and $\ce{^16N}$ are not.
## Nitrogen-13
$\ce{^13N}$ is a naturally occurring isotope that has a [[Half-Life|half-life]] of $t_{1/2}=9.965\ \pu{ min}$. This isotope undergoes [[Beta Plus Decay|beta plus decay]] to produce [[Carbon#Carbon-13|carbon-13]]. $\ce{^13N}$ can be a product of [[Oxygen#Oxygen-13|oxygen-13]] undergoing beta plus decay.

This isotope is used in [[Positron Emission Tomography|positron emission topography]], or PET scans.
## Nitrogen-14
$\ce{^14N}$ is the most abundant isotope of nitrogen. It is a stable nuclide with an abundance of $99.6\%$. $\ce{^14N}$ is one of the five stable [[Even and Odd Nuclei|odd-odd nuclides]] together with [[Hydrogen#Hydrogen-2|hydrogen-2]], [[Lithium#Lithium-6|lithium-6]], [[Boron#Boron-10|boron-10]], and [[Tantalum#Tantalum-180m|tantalum-180m]].
## Nitrogen-15
$\ce{^15N}$ is another stable isotope of nitrogen that is slightly heavier. This isotope is much less abundant than $\ce{^14N}$ with only an abundance of $0.4\%$. 
## Nitrogen-16
$\ce{^16N}$ is a synthetic isotope that has a half-life of $t_{1/2}=7.13\ \pu{ s}$. This isotope can then undergo either [[Beta Minus Decay|beta minus decay]] into [[Oxygen#Oxygen-16|oxygen-16]] or $\beta^-\alpha$ decay into [[Carbon#Carbon-12|carbon-12]]. This nuclide is commonly used as coolant for pressurised [[Water|water]] [[Nuclear Reactor|reactors]].
