An **op-amp** (or, **Operational Amplifier**) is an [[Amplifier|amplifier]] IC. It has applications ranging from audio [[Amplification|amplification]] to various analog circuits. An op-amp schematic symbol is shown below.

\usepackage{circuitikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{circuitikz}
\draw
(0,0) node[op amp](U){}
(U.-) to[short] ++(-0.5,0) node[ocirc]{} node[left]{Inverting}
(U.+) to[short] ++(-0.5,0) node[ocirc]{} node[left]{Noninverting}
(U.out) to[short] ++(0.5,0) node[ocirc]{} node[right]{Output}
;
\end{circuitikz}
\end{document}
```
Every op-amp has an inverting and noninverting input designated with a $-$ and $+$, respectively. Most op-amps operate with two dc sources, one positive and one negative, but some operate with one source. These connections are often omitted from schematic diagrams however they may be sometimes drawn as shown below.

# The ideal op-amp
The ideal op-amp is not realistic but the model allows us to analyze a circuit at a glance. Under this model, the ideal op-amp has infinite [[Voltage Gain|voltage gain]] and infinite [[Bandwidth|bandwidth]]. It additionally has infinite input [[Impedance|impedance]] and no output impedance.

# The practical op-amp
The practical op-amp is a more realistic model of an op-amp. In this model, the op amp instead has *very high* input impedance, *very high* voltage gain, and *very low* output impedance. In this model we also take into consideration the [[Noise|noise]] generated by the op-amp.
