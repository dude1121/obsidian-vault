**Conductance** is the inverse of [[Resistance|resistance]]. It is a measure of a materialâ€™s ability to conduct electrical current. It is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Siemen|siemens]] $[\text{S}]$ or Mhos $[\mho]$.

The conductance of a material is inversely proportional to its resistance.
$$ G\propto R^{-1} $$
There is no proportionality constant here.
$$ G=\frac{1}{R} $$
Much as materials can have resistivity and this helps determine their resistance, materials can also be described in terms of their **[[conductivity]]**. Conductivity ($\sigma$) is the inverse of resistivity. That is,
$$ \sigma=\rho^{-1}=\frac{1}{\rho} $$
