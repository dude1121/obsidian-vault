**Young's modulus** is a property of solids that measures the tensile or compressive [[Stiffness|stiffness]] when a [[Force|force]] is applied lengthwise. It is the modulus of [[Elasticity in Solids|elasticity]] for [[Tension|tension]] or axial [[Compression|compression]]. It is named after British scientist [[Thomas Young]].  Young's modulus is defined as,
$$
E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$$
where $E$ is Young's modulus, $\sigma$ is the tensile [[Stress|stress]] experienced by the object, and $\epsilon$ is the axial [[Strain|strain]].  The tensile stress can be found by,
$$
\sigma=\frac{F}{A}
$$
where $F$ is the applied force and $A$ is the cross-sectional [[Area|area]] of the object. Young's modulus is typically used to characterize a rod or wire stressed under either tension or compression. Since strain is dimensionless, $E$ has units of [[Newton|newtons]] per square [[Metre|metre]] $[\pu{ N/m^2}]$. 

For relatively small stresses, a bar will return to its initial length when the force is removed. The *elastic limit* of a material is the maximum stress it can endure before it becomes permanently deformed. If even this limit is exceeded until the *break point*, the material will break. Initially, the stress vs. strain plot is a straight line until it reaches the elastic limit.
