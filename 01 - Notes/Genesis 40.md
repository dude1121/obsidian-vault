# Summary
- *1 - 3*. Along with [[Joseph]], the cupbearer and the baker of [[Pharaoh]] are thrown into the prison.
- *5*. The cupbearer and the baker both have strange dreams.
- *6 - 8*. Joseph notices they are troubled. They say they require interpretation of their dreams. Joseph, being a man of God, asks them to relate their dreams to him.
- *9 - 11*. Cupbearer's dream: there is a vine before him with three branches. Blossoms bloom and ripen into grapes. He then presses the grapes into Pharaoh's cup and gives it to Pharaoh.
- *12 - 15*. Joseph's interpretation is that in three days (the branches) Pharaoh will free the cupbearer and restore his job. Joseph asks the cupbearer to remember him and mention him to Pharaoh.
- *16 - 17*. Baker's dream: three cake baskets are on his head. In the uppermost basket there is baked food and birds are plucking the food from the basket on top of his head.
- *18 - 19*. Joseph gives the interpretation. He says that Pharaoh will "lift up \[his] head", this time this is a literal meaning, as the baker will be decapitated. His body will be hanged and the birds will eat him.
	- In interpreting the dream of the cupbearer, Joseph also says that "Pharaoh will lift up your head." This is an obvious play on words between the cupbearer and baker.
