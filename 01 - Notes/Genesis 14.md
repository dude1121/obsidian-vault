[[Genesis 13|Previous]] [[Genesis 15|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 10*. [[Canaan|Canaanite]] kings rebel against four Shemite kings, namely, Chedarlaomer of Elam. The Shemites win.
- *11 - 12*. Lot captured by "the enemy."
- *13 - 16*. Abram leads a meagre army of 318 men and retrieve Lot from Hobah, north of [[Damascus]].
- *18*. This is the first and only time [[Jerusalem]] (in its short form, Salem) is mentioned in the [[Torah]]. Abram meets [[Melchizadek]] in the King's Valley, near Jerusalem. Melchizadek describes himself as a priest of "God Most High," in Hebrew, '[[Elyon|el elyon]]' (אל עליון). It is hypothesized that this is a Canaanite deity as [[Yahweh]] is not referred to by this title previously.
- *19*. Melchizadek blesses Abram.
- *20*. Abram gives a tithe to Melchizadek.
# Thoughts
According to JWs this encounter with Melchizadek has a confusing "fulfillment." If in fact Melchizadek was a pagan priest, it makes those interpretations wildly incorrect. As such, there is little info regarding this El Elyon.

While I personally do not think El Elyon refers to a pagan Canaanite deity, I think it seems unlikely that a priest in pre-Israelite Jerusalem would have the exact same faith as Abram.
