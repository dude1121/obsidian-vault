In [[Statistics|statistics]], **data** consists of information coming from observations, counts, measurements, or responses. Data is often organized into *[[Data Set|data sets]]* which themselves come in two forms: *qualitative* data and *quantitative* data. 

- Qualitative data consists of attributes, labels, or nonnumerical entries
- Quantitative data consists of numbers that are measurements or counts
# Level of measurement
Another way to characterize data sets is their *level of measurement*. There are four levels of measurement. Ordered from lowest to highest they are,
1. Nominal
2. Ordinal
3. Interval
4. Ratio
## Nominal
Data at the nominal level of measurement is qualitative *only*. At this level, data is categorized using names, labels, or qualities. No mathematical computations can be made at this level.
## Ordinal
At the ordinal level of measurement data can be either qualitative or quantitative. Data at this level can be arranged in order, or ranked, but differences between data entries are not meaningful.
## Interval
Data at the interval level can be ordered and meaningful differences between data entries can be calculated. At the interval level, a zero entry simply represents a position on a scale; the entry is not an *inherent zero*.

>[!note] Inherent Zero
>An *inherent zero* is a zero that implies "none". For example, having zero dollars in your bank account means you have no money; it is an inherent zero. However, the temperature being $0\degree\pu{ C}$ or $0\degree\pu{ F}$ does not mean there is no heat present, it is simply a position on the temperature scale.
## Ratio
Data at the ratio level is similar to data at the interval level with the added property that a zero entry is an inherent zero. A ratio of two data entries can be formed such that one data entry can be meaningfully expressed as a multiple of another.
