A particle in **nonuniform circular motion** moves similarly to a particle in [[Uniform Circular Motion|uniform circular motion]], however there is one key difference. In uniform motion, the particle has a [[Centripetal|centripetal]] [[Acceleration|acceleration]] which results solely in a change in the direction of the particle's [[Velocity|velocity]]. In nonuniform motion, the acceleration also has a [[Tangent Line|tangential]] component. In dealing with nonuniform circular motion, we refer to the centripetal acceleration as its *radial* acceleration $a_{r}$ and the tangential component as its *tangential* acceleration $a_{t}$.
$$
\vec{a}=\vec{a}_{r}+\vec{a}_{t}
$$
Unlike the radial acceleration which only results in a change in the direction of the particle's velocity, tangential acceleration results in a change in the magnitude of the particle's velocity, i.e. a change in the particle's [[Speed|speed]].
