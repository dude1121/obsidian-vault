# 1. The Long Fuse
> The weather was indeed fine, but thinking men and women were aware that Europe lived on a powder keg, and had for years. (p. 11)
- Factors contributing to [[World War I|WWI]]:
	- Population explosion in Europe.
		- "ushered in by new developments in agriculture and more especially in medicine"
		- At the beginning of 19th century European population ~ 50 million. In 1820, ~ 100 million. By 1870, 200 million. By 1914, 300 million.
	- Larger population led to more industrialization.
		- [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial revolution]] spread to continental Europe after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]
		- Broadly speaking this meant "increased amenities for larger numbers or alternatively increased frustration for those who believed they were one way or another kept from receiving their fair share."
		- These frustrations over inequality led to thinkers like [[Karl Marx]]. [[Socialism|Socialists]] and [[Communism|Communists]] vied with each other. [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] also appeared on the scene. The optimism of [[John Locke]] and [[Rene Descartes]] gave way to the "dark uncertainties" of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].
	- [[Nationalism]] also becomes largely popular at this time.
		- "So intense was nationalism that the states or powers were inevitably spoken of as if they were individual persons$~-~$because a sense of national self-satisfaction was achieved only at the expense of another nation." (p. 13)
		- This also ties into beliefs like [[Social Darwinism]]. 
	- Along with nationalism, [[Militarism]] also sees a rise.
		- This leads to young men yearning for war, largely because they themselves had never fought in one. The last large scale European war was in 1815. 
		- Since then there had been skirmishes between individual countries (e.g. the [[Crimean War]] in 1853-1856, the second war of Italian independence between France and Austria in 1859, and most notably, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870-1871 which resulted in a resounding German victory)
		- All these wars had been short, though. Or, if not short, they were distant, colonial wars, that the everyday European paid little attention to.
		- Two things change that: technology, and an "interlocking system of alliance".
## Technological advances
- Some advances were not explicitly militaristic. Barbed wire, for example, was invented in the United States to control cattle, but it found an alternate use on the battlefield in trenches.
- Other advances were definitely militaristic but their impacts were underestimated. Take the machine gun for example. In the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in the early 1900s, European spectators remarked "the machine gun is a vastly overrated weapon; it appears highly doubtful that it would be effective against trained European soldiery." (p. 15)
- Previous wars had been won essentially by the side that could mobilize their army the quickest. Therefore at the turn of the century, focus was more on mobilization efficiency rather than combat efficiency. It didn't matter if your soldiers were bad, if they got to the battlefield first, they thought, it would be an easy victory.
- These generals believed offense was what won wars, but the technological advancements made like barbed wire, machine guns, and artillery had given a major advantage to the defender, not the aggressor. 
- Since previous wars had been much shorter, the strategies of rapid mobilization and quick fighting were less effective, since as the war continued, battle fatigue quickly set in among soldiers who had never expected to fight as long as they had.
## Alliance system
![[pre-wwi-alliances.png]]
- After the Franco-Prussian war, [[Otto von Bismarck]], the chancellor of the newly unified [[German Empire]] made it his aim to isolate [[Third French Republic|France]] as much as possible. Germany sought an alliance with both [[Austria-Hungary]], a nation Germany had also recently defeated, and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. These three made up the *Three Emperors' League* and it lasted for about a decade. This could never last, however, as Russian and Austrian ambitions in the [[The Balkans|Balkans]] were incompatible. Bismarck improved Germany's ties with Austria rather than Russia, and in 1882 they signed the *Dual Alliance*, shortly thereafter including Italy to form the *Triple Alliance*.
	- However, Russia does not formally leave their alliance with Germany until 1888 when Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] ascends to the German throne and dismisses Bismarck.
- As soon as Russia is no longer tied to Germany, France seeks an alliance. They send funds to help Russia industrialize, primarily to fund the construction of Russian railroads. These two countries increased relations, having state visits back and forth, and by 1893, just three years after being cast out by Germany, Russia and France are practically allied. (p 17)
- The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] on the other hand was a "free-floating variable". While initially they were content to be on their own, the growing alliances in mainland Europe made this stance a poor strategy
	- The [[Second Boer War]] had emphasized this loneliness with the Britain seemingly standing alone against the Boer republics.
- In 1902, the British sign the Anglo-Japanese Naval Alliance, but this ally still was far from Europe. Still looking towards Europe, Germany would have been an ideal option since Kaiser Wilhelm II was [[Queen Victoria]]'s grandson and the current monarch, [[King Edward VII]]'s nephew.
	- Wilhelm was incredibly unreliable, however. His "outbursts and foolishness" push Britain towards France and away from Germany. (p. 18)
- This improving of relations with France led to better Anglo-Russian ties.
- This means that by 1907, there is essentially two main alliances forming in Europe with Britain, France, and Russia on one side (later known as the *[[Triple Entente]]*) and Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy on the other (later known as the *[[Central Powers]]*).
- Instead of preventing war, however, these two major alliances seemed to guarantee war, and a large scale war at that. Any minor conflict between two nations could be escalated easily to a large-scale continental war.
- Prior to the outbreak however, there are four major crises that all happen relatively closely to one another, and all four had to do with either the Balkans, or North Africa.
## North Africa and the First Moroccan Crisis
- 1905 - The French are "pursuing an expansionist policy in Morocco" (p. 19). The Germans are not okay with this, not because they cared particularly about Morocco but because by stopping France's ambitions in Africa they hoped to break the Anglo-French entente. In March 1905, the Kaiser goes to [[Tangiers]] and offers German friendship to the Sultan of Morocco should they ever need it.
- This becomes known as the [[First Moroccan Crisis]], and it had the opposite effect the Germans had hoped for. Not only did this not break the entente, Britain and France end up strengthening ties to one another. Not only that, but in the [[First Moroccan Crisis#Algeciras Conference|Algeciras Conference]] in 1906, not only does Germany fail in their plan to negotiate an alliance with France on their terms, Italy sides with the English and French against their ally. 
## The Bosnian Crisis
- This in itself requires a lot of setup but here are the cliff notes:
	- The [[Ottoman Empire]] is losing its grip on Europe and many Balkan states are declaring independence.[^1]
	- As these states, most of which are [[Orthodoxy|Christian Orthodox]], fight for independence, Russia, an orthodox nation as well, saw itself as the protector of these new states.
		- This was partially because of Russia's ambitions to have territory in the Mediterranean
	- Austria was opposed to Russian intervention as they had ambitions of their own.
		- Austria-Hungary at this point is a mix of many different minority groups: Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs, not to mention the Austrians and Hungarians.
- In 1908, Austria declares that they are annexing the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were already under Austrian military occupation since 1878 (p. 20)
- Bosnia and Herzegovina contained not just Bosnians but also Serbs, and the kingdom of Serbia protested this annexation. The Serbs looked to Russia for support, but the Russians did not stop the Austrians.[^2]
	- Russia was also very weak after the disastrous [[Russo-Japanese War]] and was not prepared for a military confrontation.
- Russia was forced to back down by the Kaiser despite their claims that Germany had instigated the crisis. This humiliation for the Tsar meant that, should another situation like this occur in the Balkans again, Russia must be ready to defend their Slavic brothers.
## The Second Moroccan Crisis
- In 1911 France yet again pushed claims in Morocco. Germany took exception to this again, and stationed a gunboat, the SMS Panther, off the port of Agadir[^3]
- The British are opposed to this and David Lloyd George makes a dramatic speech dubbed the "Mansion House speech" in which he lambasts the Germans.
- Germany is forced to back down and Britain and France make naval commitments in the Mediterranean. 
- Crucially, Britain also promises that it would commit troops to the Continent to fight alongside the French if and when war comes.
# 2. The Explosion
## The assassination of Franz Ferdinand
- Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]] was 84 in 1914.
	- His wife Elizabeth of Bavaria was stabbed to death in Geneva by an Anarchist in 1898.
	- His only son, Archduke Rudolf killed himself and his 17 year-old mistress at Mayerling in 1889, leaving the heir to the throne as Franz Joseph's cousin, Franz Ferdinand. (p. 22)
- The heir apparent was visiting Sarajevo in the summer of 1914. 
	- Franz Ferdinand was also the Inspector-General of the Armed Forces and he was in Bosnia to review the troops on summer maneuvers and then he was to have a tour of the city with his wife. (p. 23)
- A Serbian terrorist organization known as [[The Black Hand]] had trained a group of operatives and infiltrated them into Bosnia with "orders to kill".
	- Exactly how complicit the Serbian government was is a matter of debate. Officially the government knew nothing about it, but unofficially it seems they might have had some inklings about what was going to happen.
		- This is further muddied considering the head of the Serbian military, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević doubled as the leader of the Black Hand.
	- The Serbian ambassador had warned the Austrian government about Franz Ferdinand's visit but the Austrians did not take this threat seriously.
		- This is partially due to the Serbian King, Peter Karađorđević, has ascended to the throne due to a coup in 1903 and was largely seen as a Russian puppet.
- As Ferdinand and his wife rode through Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, a member of the Black Hand, 19-year-old Nedeljko Čabrinović, tossed a bomb at the archduke's convoy. The car carrying him and his wife dodged the bomb but it hit the car trailing them, wounding several aides and by-standers.
	- Čabrinović tried swallow a cyanide pill and jump into a nearby river, but he failed on counts and was pulled out of the river.
- After a visit at town hall where Franz Ferdinand gave a "dressing down" to the mayor of Sarajevo, the royals decided to visit the hospital to check on the wounded.
	- On their way, their chauffeur, unaware of the change in plans, took a wrong turn. When he stopped and tried to turn around, the car was momentarily parked in front of a sandwich shop in Sarajevo where another Black Hand member, [[Gavrilo Princip]], was coincidentally standing by.
- Princip walked about and fired two shots into the car, hitting the archduke and his wife, Sophie. Franz was hit in the neck, and Sophie in the lower stomach.
	- She died nearly instantly, and Franz Ferdinand died a few minutes later.
- Princip himself died in prison during the war of [[Tuberculosis|TB]]. (p. 24)
## Aftermath and the July Crisis
- The time after the assassination before the outbreak of WWI is known as the [[July Crisis]].
- For a time, many in Austria felt they were better off without the archduke.
	- Him and his wife were quickly buried in the hope that they would be quickly forgotten after the assassination.
- The Chief of the Austrian General Staff, General [[Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]], became the *de facto* leader of Austria at this time.
- Conrad was certain Russia would not intervene in this affair after their botched interventions previously.[^4]
- Conrad thought that war with Serbia would help solve some of Austria-Hungary's problems. A quick, decisive Austrian victory would re-establish the dominance of Austria in central Europe and suppress minority revolts within the empire.
- On July 23, 1914, the Austrian empire offers an ultimatum to Serbia[^5]. The ultimatum makes many requests which can be seen [[Ultimatum to Serbia, 1914|here]].
	- To be fair, Serbia did agree to almost all the requests, declining only demand 6 allowing Austrian officials to join in the investigation on Serbian territory.
- As soon as Serbia gave their reply, the Austrian ambassador to Serbia left the county.
- Serbia began mobilization before even sending their reply, and Austria began mobilizing half their army at Conrad's behest.
- Before Austria offered their ultimatum, Austria needed assurance that Germany would back them. On July 5, the Austro-Hungarian ambassador László Szőgyény-Marich Jr. approaches the Germans and meets with the Kaiser.[^6]
	- After some hesitation, the Kaiser agrees to support Austria in the event of war, known as [[Germany's Blank Cheque]].
- Russia, seeking to avoid embarrassment again, decided on July 24 that they "must not allow Serbia to be attacked and absorbed by Austria." (p. 27)
	- The next day Austria assured the Russians that they would not annex Serbian territory.
	- This assurance was insufficient though. On July 25, Russia issues preliminary mobilization orders and decide to go to war if Austria attacks Serbia.
- On July 26 the British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey proposes a general conference to deal with the Balkan crisis. France and Russia agree, but Austria declines and Germany backs this decision.
- July 27 sees the French issuing standby mobilization orders.
- Austria declares war on **July 28, 1914**. This was despite the Austrians not yet being ready for war, but they jump the gun because they feared someone else would act first.
	- At first, Germany and England had urged Austria to simply occupy Belgrade and then begin talks again.
- The Kaiser and his chancellor both found themselves backpedalling, urging Vienna to talk to the Russians. Bethmann, the chancellor, tried to promise Britain that Germany would not retain any territory it occupied after the war should they win if Britain remained neutral, but Britain rejected making any commitment.
- The [[Nicholas II|Tsar]], following reports of shelling of Belgrade, orders a full mobilization. However Wilhelm II asks Russia to back down, citing pressure Germany was putting on Austria to get them to back down as well. 
	- Nicholas II agrees and instead orders a partial mobilization only against Austria and not Germany.
- Nicholas II changes his mind again on July 30, this time ordering a general mobilization again.
	- Germany offers a 12-hour ultimatum on July 31 to Russia. At the same time, they inquire of the French government their stance on a Russo-German war.
		- France responds on August 1, stating: "The government would be guided by France's own best interests."
		- At 3:55 p.m. August 1, a general French mobilization is ordered.
	- The British request "a statement from Berlin that the neutrality of Belgium, guaranteed in the [[Treaty of 1839]], would be respected. The Germans curtly refused."
	- At 5 p.m. the same day, Austria orders a general mobilization.
- In response to the French mobilization on August 1, Germany orders a full mobilization at 4 p.m. and declares war three hours later with their ultimatum to Russia having expired.
- On August 2 the British Cabinet agrees to offer France assurance that Britain would protect the French coast.
	- Meanwhile German troops are marching through Luxembourg and the German ambassador to Belgium is demanding free passage through Belgium for German troops. Belgium declines.
- August 3, Germany declares war on France.
- August 4, Britain declares war on Germany, citing the violation of Belgian neutrality as their *cassus belli*.
	- Germany declares war on Belgium as a response.
- August 6, Austria declares war on Russia.
## Early war plans
### Austria-Hungary
- Austria-Hungary had two war plans: one was predicated on war with Serbia and the other on war with Serbia backed by Russia.
- Everything had happened so chaotically that Austria had put both plans into action. Soldiers had marched to the Serbian border only to be sent to the eastern front to fight the Russians. The Austrian armies were tired before fighting even began.
### Russia
- Russia also had two plans: one in response to a German offensive against them in Poland and another if the Germans were focused on the western front.
	- If the Germans attacked in the east, the Russian plan was to fall back to the Polish border and hold until they could mount a counter-offensive.
	- If the Germans focused on the west, the Russians would push out of Poland into Prussia and possibly Galicia.
### France
- In the years before the war, France had gone though multiple military policy upheavals. In 1911 they adopted a plan called Plan XVI calling for a major concentration of troops in eastern France and a straightforward drive into the province of Alsace-Lorraine, a province France lost in the Franco-Prussian war. 
- Shortly after they adopted this plan, General Victor Michel decided that the German offensive would likely come through Belgium. Michel suggested that the French should attack northeast through Belgium (this would require the French violating Belgian neutrality) and meet the German thrust head on. Michel was fired for this proposal.
- Michel is replaced by General Joseph Joffre. He proposes Plan XVII, modifying Plan XVI calling for an immediate two-pronged invasion of Alsace-Lorraine. He did however call for two armies to be retained on the left flank.
	- Michel makes several large mistakes, however.
		- He correctly assumes Italy will remain neutral, however he expected that Russia would be much more effective than it was.
		- He also expected the British to have a much larger impact.
		- Finally, he underestimated the size of the German army.
### Britain
- Britain was caught out in the Second Moroccan Crisis. They could send only 4 divisions to France plus cavalry and artillery, about 100,000 men.
	- For comparison, Germany mobilized around 2 million men, and France had more than 1 million.
- The British plan relied heavily on the French being able to mount an offensive and Britain would support that offensive.
### Germany
- Count Alfred von Schlieffen was the chief of German general staff from 1891 until his retirement in 1906. Schlieffen had concluded that in the event of a European war, Germany would have to fight on two fronts: France and Russia.
- Schlieffen's answer was based on the assumption that Germany could mobilize faster than any other country. The Russians were the slowest.
	- Schlieffen therefore proposed attacking France first. He assumed they would capitulate in 6 - 8 weeks, at which point Germany would switch attention to Russia.
- This turned a potential 2-front war into 2 1-front wars happening one right after the other.
- Schlieffen also (correctly) assumed the French would mount an offensive into Alsace-Lorraine. He planned to have minimal forces on this border, allowing the French to push east into German territory.
- The main German attack would come through Holland and Belgium, to the west to the coast of the English Channel, then straight south to an undefended Paris. They would then come back east to encircle the French troops that pushed into Alsace-Lorraine.
- Once the French were defeated, the Germans would take switch to the eastern front via train (Germany had the best train system in Europe at the time) and fight the Russians who, they thought, would only just have been mobilized.
- Schlieffen was replaced with Helmuth von Moltke. Moltke weakened the right flank upon which Schlieffen had predicated his plan. Moltke decided to violate only Belgian neutrality and shove all the German forces through Belgium. 
- The problem with this plan was that, if it worked, it would work very well, but if it failed (which it did) then Germany was in a terrible position to fight a two-front war.
# 3. The Opening Battles in the West
![[europe-pre-wwi.png]]
- "The opening of the campaign in the West resolved into three series of several smallish battles." (p.37)
1. The first series is the German push through Belgium.
2. The second is the "Battle of the Frontiers" which comprised the battles in Lorraine, the Ardennes, the Sambre, and the battle of Mons.
3. The third was the Allied retreat, mainly consisting of the battles of Le Cateau and Guise.
- These three series set the stage for the [[Battle of the Marne]].
## The German advance in Belgium
- Though Germany requested passage through Belgium, they did not expect to get it.
- Although Belgium was "perpetually neutral" they did maintain a small army.
	- Since Moltke did not want to violate Dutch sovereignty, he pushed three German armies through a small 35 mile gap to the north of the Ardennes Forest. To do so, they needed to get past Liége.
- Liége was ringed by twelve independent fortresses in a circle of just over ten miles diameter. 
- King Albert of Belgium expected the German advance to be slower than it was. He had his armies concentrated on the west bank of the Maas River. The goal was either to hold the Germans off entirely or, at the very least, divert the Germans south into France.
- However the call-up of Belgian reserves does not go well and the Belgian army is not able to get to their stations before the German advance hits.
- Germany on the other hand had designated a specific army that had the goal of destroying the fortresses surrounding Liége.
	- The Germanic mobilization would take about 2 weeks, so these three German armies in Belgium had that much time to take Liége. 
- 4 August. Germany declares war and all three armies cross the Belgian border.
- 5 August. Germany demands Liége to surrender. They refuse.
- 6 August. Belgian general Leman sends away his infantry and tries to hold Liége as long as he can with fortress troops. The Belgian have successfully repelled the German attack so far.
	- In the night of August 6, the Germans' 2nd Army's Chief of Staff, General Ludendorff, rallies his troops and they keep pushing until they finally break the fortress line and Ludendorff negotiates a surrender.
- The Germans were then able to set up large 420mm guns on August 12 which obliterates the Liége forts.
- 14 August. Germany completes their mobilization.
- 16 August. The final Liége forts surrender and the road to France is open.
## The Battle of the Frontiers
![[battle-of-the-frontiers.png]]
- Unlike the Schlieffen plan, the French war plan was more of statement than a plan. (p. 39)
	- The idea was to concentrate the French armies along the French-German border and have them move to attack as they fully mobilized
- 14 August. France's 1st and 2nd armies under Generals Dubail and Castelnau make progress into Lorraine.![[l'illustration-august-15-1914.png]]
	- The first wartime issue of L'illustration, pictured above
	- The French encountered the 6th and 7th German armies, commanded in practice by General Kraft von Dellmensingen.
		- Dellmensingen's plan was to allow the French to push into Alsace-Lorraine according to the Schlieffen plan, but mount a counteroffensive when they were able, something not in the Schlieffen plan.
	- 20 August. The Germans counterattack in Lorraine.[^7] The Germans slaughtered Frenchmen with their machine guns, something the Germans had in greater supply than the French. 
		- The French did have their own guns, particularly the *French 75*.
		  ![[French-75.JPG]]
		- This was insufficient, however, as the French were already weakened and could not repel the German advance. On the night of August 20, the French retreated and by August 22 they were all the way back to the Meurthe River.
	- This German advance actually served to disorganize the German forces, as Dellmensingen was not meant to advance this early and this quickly. The Crown Prince of Bavaria, Rupprecht, was nominally in charge of the 6th and 7th armies, and he bullied Moltke into moving six corps south to support the 6th and 7th into France.
		- Rupprecht evidently wanted to expand the single encirclement of the Schlieffen plan into a double envelopment but Germany did not have the resources or manpower for this.
		- The Lorraine battle died down from mutual exhaustion.
- While this was happening, the French 3rd, 4th, and 5th armies push into the Ardennes. Joffre thought he could push his men into Belgium before the German advance came. General Lanrezac of the 5th army was concerned about this move and pestered Joffre to move him to a different front, which Joffre reluctantly did.
	- The French 3rd and 4th armies meet the German 4th and 5th armies, under General Albrecht and the Crown Prince of Prussia.
- 21 August. The French 5th army led by General Lanrezac is moving up to Namur, Belgium. This was a disastrous move. The 3rd German army under General Hausen moved towards Lanrezac's right flank, the 2nd German army was now past Liége and moving towards Lanrezac's front and left flanks. 
	- As of this point, the location of the German 1st army was unknown to the French.
	- On the 21st, the French 5th and German 2nd armies meet along the Sambre. The Germans push the French back, but there was a British army on its way to help the French 5th by attacking the German 2nd's open flank.
	- However before the British could arrive, the 3rd German army arrives.
- 22 August. The German and French armies collide and the French are worse off. They are forced back, but they are not entirely defeated as the Germans had thought. Lanrezac retreats from Namur on August 23rd.
### Battle of Mons - August 23
- The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) reaches Mons on August 22 and takes a defensive position here.
- The German 1st army under General Kluck hits the BEF head on at Mons on the 23rd. 
- The British are unable to hold the line as the Germans vastly outnumbered the British are were able to push into Mons. 
- The BEF fall back to meet with Lanrezac in what is known as the [[Retreat from Mons]]. (p. 44)
- Joffre is forced to re-organize his lines. 
- Moltke's camp is in more chaos than the French. Their intelligence assessments are way off base and they believed at this point they had already won the war in the west, that the French and British were in full retreat.
	- Moltke therefore is pressured into moving cops to the south, but is forced to take two more from the right flank to support the eastern front, since Russia had began mobilizing quicker than expected.
- 26 August. The British forces are falling back but half of the BEF, the 2nd Corps led by General Smith-Dorrien, remain at Le Cateau while the other half along with the French fall back further.
### Battle of Le Cateau - August 26 (p. 45-46)
- Half the BEF (British Expeditionary Force), specifically Smith-Dorrien’s II Corps, chose to stand and fight rather than retreat due to exhaustion.
	- Germans attacked both flanks early in the day, nearly collapsing the British line.
- French cavalry (Sordet’s) appeared late in the day, stalling the Germans who feared a larger French presence.
- Smith-Dorrien managed a successful nighttime withdrawal, but lost nearly 8,000 men and about 40 guns.
- Le Cateau was the largest British battle since Waterloo and, despite inflicting some damage, was ultimately a defeat.
### Battle of Guise (St. Quentin) - August 29 (p. 46-47)
- Joffre, thinking the British were on the verge of collapse, ordered Lanrezac to attack Kluck’s flank to relieve pressure on the British.
- Though reluctant and under pressure from Bülow's 2nd Army, Lanrezac began turning his army westward.
- Bülow attacked Lanrezac’s right flank near Guise; heavy fighting ensued with major losses on both sides.
- Lanrezac ordered Franchet d’Espèrey to launch a counterattack in the afternoon.
- The French succeeded in driving back two of Bülow’s corps, including the elite Prussian Guards, to the Oise River.
- The success forced the Germans to reassess their view of the French as defeated.
## Strategic Shift (p. 47-48)
- Moltke receives reports about Guise two days late, believing it to be a major German victory. Convinced the French are in full retreat, he issues pursuit orders.
- Molkte ignored intelligence of French forces massing near Paris.
- General Kluck is ordered to swing wide to disrupt any French concentration but also to maintain contact with neighbouring German armies.
- Caught between contradictory orders, Kluck opts to change his axis of advance from southwest to south-southeast. This shifts his army east of Paris, unintentionally exposing his flank to the French forces near the capital.
# 4.The Marne and the Race to the Sea
## Late August – Early September: Setting the Stage for the Marne (p. 49)
- Northern France was in chaos as French forces withdrew and German columns advanced. Paris prepared for siege, but morale remained intact.
- General Joffre reorganised French forces by creating the 6th Army under General Maunoury to defend Paris, and the 9th Army under General Foch, a committed offensive strategist.
- Aerial reconnaissance revealed General Kluck’s southeast turn, allowing Joffre to plan a counteroffensive to strike the German right flank from Paris.
## 1–5 September: Command Shifts and Strategic Reorientation (pp. 49–51)
- General Sir John French, rattled by earlier defeats, declared the B.E.F. unfit for battle and planned to withdraw beyond the Seine.
- Joffre dismissed General Lanrezac on 3 September and appointed General Franchet d’Espèrey, a more assertive and cooperative commander.
- On 5 September, Joffre met French at Melun and urged him to join a decisive counteroffensive, appealing to British honour. French agreed to assist.
## 5–6 September: Opening Moves at the Marne (pp. 51–53)
- General Moltke, confused by unclear reports from the front, ordered Kluck to support General Bülow by advancing in echelon behind him. However, Kluck was already two days ahead.
- General Gronau, covering Kluck’s flank near the Ourcq, encountered French cavalry and infantry on 5 September and established a defensive line.
- Fighting on the Ourcq began as French forces under Maunoury attacked prematurely. Kluck began redirecting forces north, creating a 30-mile gap between himself and Bülow.
## 6–8 September: The Allied Counterattack Develops (pp. 53–54)
- On 6 September, d’Espèrey’s 5th Army and the B.E.F. began advancing. While the British made no contact, the French clashed with both Kluck’s and Bülow’s forces.
- Foch's 9th Army attacked across the St. Gond Marshes but suffered heavily. Bülow, mistaking French persistence for renewed strength, became cautious.
- On 7 September, Maunoury continued the attack on the Ourcq; despite setbacks, artillery under Colonel Nivelle halted a major German counterattack.
- General Gallieni mobilised Parisian taxis to rush two regiments to the front, bolstering Maunoury’s line. The symbolic effort helped 6th Army hold firm.
## 8–10 September: German Withdrawal Begins (pp. 54–56)
- Foch’s forces were nearly broken by attacks from Bülow and General Hausen on 8 September, but he insisted on continuous assaults despite extreme exhaustion.
- That night, d’Espèrey launched a successful counterattack, forcing Bülow’s right to retreat and widening the gap with Kluck.
- Moltke, paralysed by the breakdown in communication, sent Colonel Hentsch to assess the situation. Finding Bülow in retreat, Hentsch convinced Kluck to also withdraw.
- On 9 September, the B.E.F. crossed the Marne, flanking Kluck and prompting him to retreat. The German advance had reached its high-water mark.
- On 10 September, fighting ceased as German forces withdrew north. The Battle of the Marne had ended in Allied victory.
## Strategic Aftermath of the Marne (pp. 56)

- The Schlieffen Plan collapsed. Historians debate whether it was ever viable: some cite logistical impossibility, others blame Moltke’s weakening of the right wing.
- Joffre maintained calm and clarity, while Moltke faltered and was replaced on 14 September by General von Falkenhayn.
## Mid-September – November: The “Race to the Sea” and Entrenchment (pp. 56–59)
- Germans regrouped along a new east-west line from Noyon to Verdun. From 14 September, Allied assaults—especially by the B.E.F.—failed to break through entrenched positions along the Aisne.
- This marked the beginning of trench warfare. Both sides attempted to outflank each other northward in what became known as the "Race to the Sea".
- By 10 October, trench lines extended from the Swiss border to the Channel. Battles occurred across Picardy, Artois, and into Flanders—names like Arras, Vimy, and Ypres entered the historical lexicon.
- The First Battle of Ypres (Oct–Nov) was Germany’s final attempt to break Allied lines before winter, ending only with the last reserves and onset of harsh weather.
## End of the Campaign Season (p. 59)
- Subsequent offensives—around Verdun, in the Vosges, and in Champagne—failed. A static front set in.
- The Germans, occupying foreign territory, held the high ground. The burden of attack fell on the French and British.
- With both sides entrenched, attention turned to the Eastern Front, where the Russian "Steamroller" might yet shift the balance.
# 5. The War in the East
## Context and Strategic Geography (p. 61)
- The Eastern Front was over 1,000 miles long (four times the length of the Western Front) and much more difficult logistically.
- The Schlieffen Plan allocated a secondary, defensive role to the East, but Russia moved offensively early on, complicating German plans.
## Russia Before the War (pp. 61–62)
- Russia was undergoing rapid industrialisation and social strain, with deep dissatisfaction lingering from the 1905 revolution.
- Efforts to modernise the military post-Russo-Japanese War were undermined by internal factionalism, especially around General Sukhomlinov.
## Strategic Dispositions and Miscalculations (pp. 62–63)
- Germany and Austria-Hungary fortified their borders conservatively. Russia built up around Warsaw but adopted a divergent rail gauge, harming their own mobility.
- Russia’s 1910 plan correctly anticipated Germany’s focus on France but prioritised an offensive into East Prussia, despite weak coordination.
## August 17–20: Russian Invasion of East Prussia (pp. 63–64)
- General Rennenkampf's 1st Army and General Samsonov's 2nd Army advanced on separate axes into East Prussia, poorly coordinated and lacking cavalry screens.
- General von Prittwitz, commanding Germany’s 8th Army, intercepted unencrypted Russian radio traffic and planned to strike Rennenkampf first.
- On 20 August, the Battle of Gumbinnen ended in a costly draw. Von Prittwitz panicked and proposed retreating behind the Vistula.
## August 23–29: The Battle of Tannenberg (pp. 64–66)
- General von Moltke replaced von Prittwitz with General Hindenburg and General Ludendorff, though Colonel Max Hoffmann had already set the trap.
- By 25 August, German forces began surrounding Samsonov’s 2nd Army, which remained unaware due to poor reconnaissance and communications.
- On 27 August, General von François smashed the Russian left with overwhelming artillery fire. The right also collapsed, leaving the centre isolated.
- By 29 August, roughly 150,000 Russians were trapped. Attempts to break out failed amidst a massacre. Around 125,000 were killed, wounded, or captured. Samsonov reportedly committed suicide.
## September 8–10: The Battle of the Masurian Lakes (pp. 67–68)
- General Rennenkampf failed to support Samsonov and resumed advancing alone. Hindenburg and Ludendorff launched a double envelopment.
- German forces broke through the southern Russian line on 9 September. Rennenkampf ordered a retreat, which was only saved by a sacrificial Russian attack on the German centre.
- The battle cost Russia another 125,000 casualties and further discredited its military effectiveness.
## August–September: Austrian Disaster in Galicia (pp. 68–69)
- General Ivanov's Russian Southwest Army Group clashed with General Conrad von Hötzendorf’s Austrians. Both sides misused cavalry and blundered into major battles.
- Conrad mistakenly diverted troops to the left while the main Russian thrust hit his weakened right. Russian forces advanced and outflanked the Austrians at Rava-Ruska.
- By early September, the Austrians had retreated 100 miles into the Carpathians, suffering over 350,000 casualties and severe losses among Germanic troops.
## October–November: War in Poland and Silesia (pp. 70–71)
- Responding to French pressure, the Russians shifted troops north to attack Silesia. Hindenburg launched a spoiling attack toward Warsaw on 11 November.
- General Rennenkampf’s dispersed 1st Army was hit hard. Russian 2nd and 5th Armies reversed course to reinforce the collapsing flank.
- Near Łódź, German forces nearly encircled Russian troops, but reinforcements arrived just in time. The Russian Silesian offensive failed, and western Poland fell to German control.
## February 1915: Winter Battle of Masuria (pp. 71–72)
- Despite von Falkenhayn’s Western focus, Hindenburg and Ludendorff launched one last eastern offensive with Austrian support.
- The Austrian attack collapsed; the fortress of Przemyśl surrendered with 100,000 men. The German offensive pushed back Russian 10th Army but failed to achieve a decisive victory.
- Harsh winter conditions caused massive frostbite casualties. Though the Germans inflicted 200,000 losses, they could not end the war in the East.
## August–December 1914: Austria’s Failed Invasions of Serbia (pp. 72–73)
- Field Marshal Putnik’s Serbian army, experienced and tenacious, repelled three Austrian invasions led by General Potiorek.
- In August, Austria was driven back after the Battle of the Jadar. In September, a failed attempt into Bosnia forced Serbia to retreat.
- In November, Austria captured Belgrade, but Putnik counterattacked in December, liberating the city. Austria lost nearly 225,000 men; Serbia around 200,000.
## Winter 1914–1915: Stalemate Sets In (p. 74)
- Across the Eastern Front, winter froze operations. Casualties mounted. Soldiers lived in trenches under horrific conditions. The promise of a short war had ended.
# 6. The War at Sea
## Naval Expectations and Strategic Context (pp. 75–76)
- Pre-war theorists expected rapid, decisive fleet battles, but the war at sea began slowly and inconclusively.
- Admiral Sir John Fisher reformed the Royal Navy and introduced HMS Dreadnought in 1906, revolutionising battleship design.
- Dreadnoughts became the new standard for naval strength; by 1914, Britain had 20 and Germany 13.
## Pre-War Rivalries and Doctrines (pp. 76–77)
- France’s Jeune École promoted commerce warfare, but strategic focus shifted to battleships.
- Submarines were not yet viewed as tools for commerce raiding.
- Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz led German naval expansion for prestige, not practical strategic need; German ships were technically excellent but designed for North Sea operations only.
## Opening Naval Positions in 1914 (pp. 77–78)
- Both sides concentrated their fleets in the North Sea. Britain expected a quick Trafalgar-style battle.
- Germany, knowing it was outnumbered, avoided engagement. No major fleet battle occurred in 1914.
## Key Early Naval Engagements (pp. 78–82)
- In the Mediterranean, German cruisers Goeben and Breslau escaped British pursuit and entered Constantinople on 10 August, drawing Turkey into the war.
- Admiral Graf von Spee led a German Pacific squadron to the Chilean coast. On 1 November, he destroyed Admiral Cradock’s inferior force at the Battle of Coronel.
- Britain responded at the Battle of the Falklands on 8 December. Admiral Sturdee’s superior force sank most of von Spee’s ships.
- Other German surface raiders such as Emden and Karlsruhe had short-lived success but were neutralised by the end of 1914. The surface threat to British commerce was eliminated outside the North Sea.
## North Sea Operations and Heligoland Bight (pp. 82–84)
- Admiral Sir John Jellicoe commanded the Grand Fleet from Scapa Flow and adopted a cautious containment strategy.
- Germany’s fleet, based at Wilhelmshaven, was largely inactive. The Kaiser restricted its use to avoid risk.
- On 28 August, British forces won the Battle of Heligoland Bight, sinking three German cruisers. The result increased German caution and curtailed fleet operations.
## The Battle of Dogger Bank (pp. 84–86)
- On 24 January 1915, Admiral Hipper attempted a German raid, but British codebreaking gave Admiral Beatty advance warning.
- Beatty’s battlecruisers intercepted the German force and sank Blücher, but miscommunication allowed the other German ships to escape.
- British signalling was poor, and their shells lacked penetration. The Germans improved armour and damage control; the British failed to address their material deficiencies. Admiral von Ingenohl was dismissed.
## Submarine Emergence and Early Impact (pp. 86–88)
- Submarines were controversial and poorly understood. International law limited their use against merchant shipping, reducing their immediate utility.
- Germany began the war with 18 operational U-boats. U-21 sank a cruiser on 5 September; U-9 sank three British cruisers on 22 September.
- Submarine attacks caused panic. HMS Audacious was lost to a mine on 27 October. The Grand Fleet temporarily withdrew to Irish waters.
- By late 1914, submarines were not yet used for commerce raiding, but they were already affecting British naval deployments. Britain declared a blockade; Germany began exploring unrestricted submarine warfare in response.
# 7. The Western Front, 1915
## Strategic Reassessment and War of Attrition (pp. 90–91)
- Early expectations of a short war had failed; the war became a protracted conflict driven by nationalism, industrial capacity, and credit.
- With a stalemate on all fronts, both sides explored new strategies—seeking allies, technological breakthroughs, and new offensives to break the deadlock.
- General von Falkenhayn, as German Chief of Staff, believed victory could come only in the West through attrition, but was opposed by General Hindenburg and General Ludendorff, who prioritised the East.
## Allied Strategic Debates (pp. 91–92)
- Britain was divided between “Westerners” like General Sir John French and Lord Kitchener, who favoured focusing on France, and “Easterners” like Admiral Sir John Fisher and First Lord Winston Churchill, who sought alternatives to frontal fighting.
- For France, the war could only be fought on the Western Front. With Britain still mobilising, 1915 became France’s year to lead major offensives.
## The British Offensive at Neuve Chapelle (p. 93)
- Unable to extend his line as requested by General Joffre, General French instead launched an attack at Neuve Chapelle on 10 March under General Haig.
- The British achieved initial success with a heavy bombardment and rapid advance but stalled after three days due to poor coordination. They suffered 13,000 casualties but saw it as a tactical success worth refining.
## The Second Battle of Ypres and First Use of Gas (pp. 93–95)
- On 22 April, von Falkenhayn launched a limited offensive near Ypres using chlorine gas, the first deployment of chemical weapons in the war.
- The French colonial troops broke, creating a four-mile gap. The 1st Canadian Division held firm under extreme conditions, preventing a breakthrough.
- General Foch ordered a counterattack; General Smith-Dorrien proposed withdrawal and was dismissed by General French, who replaced him with General Plumer—who withdrew anyway.
- A second gas attack on 24 May failed to break British lines. The battle ended with high casualties on both sides but no strategic gain.
## French and British Offensives in Artois (pp. 95–96)
- Joffre resumed his Artois offensive in May to capture Vimy Ridge. General Pétain led a strong French force that initially advanced but was repulsed from the crest.
- The battle degenerated into attritional fighting. French losses exceeded 100,000.
- The British supported with attacks at Aubers Ridge and Festubert but achieved little, partly due to ammunition shortages. Canadian Minister Sir Sam Hughes criticised British tactics as better suited to cattle than men.
## The Shell Crisis and Autumn Offensive Planning (pp. 96–97)
- Shortages of shells, especially for artillery, crippled British operations. David Lloyd George was appointed Minister of Munitions and began resolving the crisis.
- Joffre insisted on a new offensive in the autumn. France would strike again in Champagne and Artois, while Britain attacked at Loos.
## The Second Battle of Champagne (pp. 97–98)
- Joffre launched the main offensive on 25 September with over 30 divisions under Generals Pétain and de Langle de Cary.
- The French broke through the first German line but were halted at the second, which had been constructed as part of von Falkenhayn’s new defence-in-depth system.
- The battle devolved into a month of attrition. The French took 20,000 prisoners and 100 guns but lost 145,000 men.
## The Third Battle of Artois and the Battle of Loos (pp. 98–100)
- The French again failed to take Vimy Ridge, despite brave assaults. Fighting lasted through October with no strategic change.
- At Loos, General Haig’s 1st Army, including regulars and new volunteers, attacked on 25 September. Poison gas was used for the first time by the British.
- Initial gains were made but follow-up troops arrived disorganised. The main assault on the second German line became a massacre as troops advanced into machine-gun fire.
- German troops were shocked by the outdated British tactics. The battle became known as the leichenfeld von Loos—the “corpsefield of Loos.”
- General French was dismissed and replaced by General Haig.
## Conclusion and Casualties (pp. 100–101)
- The campaign season ended with the onset of winter. Britain lost 279,000 men in 1915; the original B.E.F. was virtually destroyed.
- Germany lost 612,000 on the Western Front; France suffered the worst with 1,292,000 casualties in 1915 alone.
- The war expanded throughout the year; the Western Front’s disasters were only one part of a growing global catastrophe.
# 8. Widening the War: Turkey, Italy, and the United States
## Strategic Expansion and the Search for Advantage (p. 102)
- As the war stalemated in late 1914, both sides searched for new allies or fronts to shift the balance.
- Turkey joined the Central Powers early; Italy remained neutral until 1915; the United States stayed out but became a key target of diplomatic effort.
  - This expansion was driven by the belief that one more ally—or one more front—could decisively tip the scales.
## The Ottoman Empire’s Entry into the War (pp. 102–104)
- The Ottoman Empire, in long decline and fractured by nationalist unrest, became increasingly aligned with Germany through military reform and economic concessions.
  - German officers like General Liman von Sanders modernised the Turkish Army and built influence.
  - The Berlin–Baghdad railway symbolised growing German–Ottoman cooperation.
- In 1913, [[Enver Pasha]] seized power through a coup and pursued an alliance with Germany; a secret treaty was signed on 2 August 1914.
- Turkey entered the war by bombarding Russian ports in late October. Britain annexed Cyprus and Egypt in response.
- The Caucasus campaign began at the turn of the year, targeting both Russian forces and Armenian populations.
  - [[The Armenian Genocide]] began under the cover of this campaign.
  - The broader conflict marked a major entry of the Middle East into the First World War.
## Italy and the Secret Treaty of London (pp. 105–107)
- Italy declared neutrality in 1914, citing the defensive nature of the Triple Alliance.
- Italian ambitions focused on Austria-Hungarian territory, especially the Trentino and South Tyrol.
- Foreign Minister Baron Sonnino demanded compensation, but Austria's grudging offers came too late.
- Britain and France promised more—offering Austrian, Turkish, and colonial spoils. The [[Secret Treaty of London]] was signed on 26 April 1915.
  - Italy was promised control over the Dalmatian coast, Adalia (in Turkey), and parts of Africa.
- Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May. Prime Minister Antonio Salandra led a divided nation into war with the slogan sacro egoismo.
  - King Victor Emmanuel III refused Salandra’s resignation and supported intervention.
## The Italian Front and the Battles of the Isonzo (pp. 107–109)
- General Luigi Cadorna commanded Italy’s poorly equipped but large army.
  - The mountainous terrain and Austrian high ground made offensive action nearly impossible.
- The only viable route of attack was along the Isonzo River toward Gorizia.
- Italy launched four offensives between June and December 1915 (First to Fourth Battles of the Isonzo).
  - All failed to achieve strategic success and incurred massive casualties: 66,000 dead, 190,000 wounded, 22,000 captured.
  - Austrian commander Archduke Eugen adopted a defensive strategy, exploiting terrain advantages.
- The front froze in winter, opening a new but costly front for Austria-Hungary.
## American Neutrality and Shifting Sentiment (pp. 109–111)
- President [[Woodrow Wilson]] declared neutrality, urging Americans to remain impartial “in thought as well as action.”
- While initially indifferent, Americans began to take sides based on ethnic ties and Allied propaganda.
  - British propaganda was especially effective, highlighting German atrocities like the destruction of Louvain and execution of Edith Cavell.
- U.S. industry boomed as it supplied matériel to the Allies; American financial interests increasingly aligned with an Allied victory.
  - The disparity in shipping tonnage (Britain’s 20 million vs. Germany’s 5.5 million) meant that neutrality favoured the Allies in practice.
## Blockade, Commerce, and Submarine Warfare (pp. 111–113)
- Britain implemented a harsh blockade, expanding contraband lists and interfering with U.S. trade.
- U.S. businesses protested blacklists and contract interference, but Wilson’s government protested only weakly.
- Germany responded with submarine warfare, eventually abandoning cruiser rules due to British countermeasures.
  - Armed merchantmen and decoy ships (Q-ships) forced U-boats to rely on torpedoes and attack without warning.
  - The conflict over neutral shipping rights echoed issues from the Napoleonic Wars and the American Civil War.
## The Lusitania Crisis and U.S.–German Relations (p. 113)
- On 7 May 1915, a German U-boat [[Sinking of the Lusitania|sank the Lusitania]] off Ireland. Of 1,198 dead, 128 were American.
- Britain portrayed the sinking as barbaric; Germany argued the ship was armed and carrying military supplies.
  - The Lusitania was indeed carrying matériel and listed as an armed merchant cruiser, though this was downplayed publicly.
- Wilson demanded an apology and restrictions; Germany promised to cease attacks on passenger ships.
  - Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan resigned rather than support Wilson’s stance.
- Wilson still hoped for American mediation and declared the U.S. “too proud to fight,” though economic and political momentum increasingly favoured the Allies.
# 9. The Dardanelles
## The Strategic Vision (p. 115)
- The Allies sought an alternative to the Western Front stalemate in 1915, including poison gas, new fronts, and a strike against Turkey.
- Russia, under pressure in the Caucasus, requested a diversion. Churchill advocated an attack on the Dardanelles to knock Turkey out of the war.
  - Admiral Sir John Fisher initially supported the plan; Lord Kitchener opposed diverting resources from France.
- The War Council approved a naval expedition with Constantinople as the objective, believing Turkey would collapse quickly.
## Naval Assault Plans (pp. 115–120)
- Admiral S. H. Carden planned a cautious advance through the straits, targeting shore batteries and sweeping mines.
- Naval attacks began on 19 February; outer forts were neutralised by 25 February. Progress stalled due to bad weather and Turkish resistance.
  - Minesweeping was ineffective; trawlers were slow, under-armed, and reluctant under fire.
- On 18 March, Admiral John de Robeck replaced Carden and launched a major assault.
  - Several battleships struck hidden mines and sank, including Bouvet, Inflexible, Irresistible, and Ocean.
  - The naval assault was abandoned. Some believed it could have succeeded with persistence, but the decision shifted to land forces.
## Planning the Land Invasion (pp. 120–121)
- General Sir Ian Hamilton was appointed to lead the invasion, despite the lack of preparation or clear objectives.
- British, French, and Anzac forces regrouped at Alexandria and Lemnos to prepare for amphibious landings.
  - The plan included landings at Cape Helles (29th Division), Anzac Cove (ANZACs), and feints at Kum Kale and Bulair.
- Turkish defences were thinly spread, with two divisions and reserves held inland on the Khilid Bahr Plateau.
## Landings of 25 April 1915 (pp. 121–124)
- The French landed at Kum Kale as a diversion; the Royal Naval Division demonstrated at Bulair.
- The Anzacs landed a mile north of their intended site due to currents, encountered light resistance at first, but were soon halted by Mustapha Kemal’s rapid reinforcement.
- The 29th Division landed at five beaches near Cape Helles:
  - S and X Beaches met light resistance and established footholds.
  - W Beach was mined, wired, and swept by machine guns; troops came ashore in towed boats and took heavy casualties but secured ground.
  - V Beach saw the River Clyde beached as an improvised landing craft; troops pouring from it were massacred by Turkish fire.
    - The landing failed by mid-morning, and troops were diverted to W Beach.
  - Y Beach, closest to key objectives, was nearly unopposed.
    - British troops could have taken Krithia and Achi Baba unchallenged, but confusion and rigid orders stalled the advance.
    - They withdrew the next day under pressure from minimal Turkish forces.
- By nightfall, the British had more troops ashore than the Turks in contact, but were disorganised and losing momentum.
## Trench Warfare and Stalemate (pp. 124–125)
- The front stabilised within two days into entrenched positions, resembling a miniature Western Front.
- Hamilton blamed barbed wire and machine guns for preventing open combat, which he believed favoured the moral superiority of British volunteers.
  - He called for more artillery and shells to overcome Turkish defences.
- The initial failure turned Gallipoli into a neglected sideshow, with limited reinforcements and dwindling political support.
## Attacks in May and June (p. 125)
- Repeated Allied assaults attempted to capture Achi Baba and break out of the beachheads.
  - At Anzac Cove, trenches were so close that Australians roofed them over to block grenades.
  - Some Australian troops attacked hand-to-hand in Turkish trenches in desperate, costly raids.
- Casualties mounted; the front remained static despite brutal effort and sacrifice.
## The Suvla Bay Offensive (pp. 125–126)
- Lord Kitchener, now a supporter, sent three more divisions. Hamilton planned a major offensive for August.
- Suvla Bay was chosen for a new landing to outflank Turkish positions and link with the Anzacs.
- On 6 August, assaults began across all fronts; the Anzacs attacked furiously but made little progress in rugged terrain.
- General Sir Frederick Stopford landed 35,000 men at Suvla Bay against only 1,800 Turkish gendarmes.
  - Stopford, aged and out of touch, failed to advance. Troops disembarked, swam, wandered, and stalled.
  - By 9 August, Turkish reinforcements had arrived and blocked further movement.
  - Hamilton relieved Stopford but it was too late; Suvla Bay, like the rest of Gallipoli, was bogged down.
## Collapse and Withdrawal (p. 126)
- Hamilton was replaced by General Sir Charles Munro, who recommended evacuation.
- Churchill left the government and took a field command in France; Kitchener’s influence declined.
- The evacuation, carried out at the end of 1915, was the only part of the campaign that fully succeeded.
## Aftermath (p. 127)
- The failure raised long-lasting questions about whether the Dardanelles could have changed the course of the war.
  - Could a breakthrough have helped Russia? Prevented revolution? Altered the balance of the war?
- The Gallipoli campaign became one of the most debated “what ifs” of the First World War.
# 10. Success and Failure in the East
## German Strategic Debates and Russian Vulnerability (p. 128)
- German leaders were divided between General von Falkenhayn, who favoured victory in the West, and General Hindenburg and General Ludendorff, who argued for campaigns in the East.
- Russia appeared the weakest enemy in 1915, suffering from supply shortages, mismanagement, and poor transportation rather than actual lack of resources.
  - Shells were stockpiled in depots but not delivered to the front, as supply officers feared they’d be wasted.
- Russian military inefficiency and corruption deepened the crisis. The government and army lagged behind societal change and industrial demands.
## Decline of Tsarist Authority (pp. 128–130)
- Tsar [[Nicholas II]] and Empress Alexandra lost public confidence as wartime failures mounted.
  - Their son, Alexei, had haemophilia, and their secrecy about it bred distrust.
  - [[Rasputin]] gained influence over the royal family by helping Alexei, but his reputation as a mystic and scandalous figure led to national outrage.
- Nicholas resisted modernisation and clung to personal autocracy, while Alexandra urged him to rule more harshly.
  - This isolation and rigidity contributed significantly to the regime’s loss of legitimacy.
## The Gorlice–Tarnów Breakthrough (pp. 130–132)
- The Central Powers decided to launch a major spring offensive in Galicia to pre-empt a Russian attack and protect Austria-Hungary.
- On 2 May 1915, Field Marshal August von Mackensen launched a massive artillery barrage near Gorlice and Tarnów.
  - Russian lines were shattered; the 3rd Army collapsed and Mackensen advanced rapidly.
- By the end of May, Russia had retreated over 80 miles, losing the San and Dniester lines and relieving pressure on Austria.
## Follow-up Operations and Fall of Poland (pp. 132–133)
- In June, after Italy entered the war, Hindenburg persuaded German leadership to continue pressure in the East.
- A pincer movement aimed at Warsaw was launched in July: Mackensen from the south and Hindenburg from East Prussia.
- Grand Duke Nicholas, Russian commander-in-chief, chose to abandon Poland to preserve the army.
  - Russian forces were trapped at Novogeorgievsk, losing the fortress and 1,600 guns.
  - Warsaw fell, and by late August, the Russians had retreated to the Pripet Marshes; Brest-Litovsk fell two weeks later.
- By September’s end, Russian forces had withdrawn another 100 miles; 2 million casualties were recorded, half as prisoners.
  - Austria’s morale remained low despite victory—sickness outpaced combat losses.
## Tsar Nicholas Assumes Command (pp. 133–134)
- In a political move, Tsar Nicholas dismissed Grand Duke Nicholas and took personal command on 1 September 1915.
  - The decision was widely seen as disastrous: the Tsar lacked military competence, and his departure allowed Alexandra and Rasputin to dominate domestic affairs.
  - This tied the fate of the monarchy to battlefield outcomes, a dangerous gamble as Russian defeats continued.
## The Fall of Serbia (pp. 134–137)
- Serbia had successfully resisted Austria in 1914 but was exhausted by epidemics and isolation in 1915.
- Von Falkenhayn prioritised bringing Bulgaria into the war to secure a route to Turkey and aid Gallipoli.
- Bulgaria signed an alliance with the Central Powers on 6 September and mobilised on 23 September.
- A combined German, Austrian, and Bulgarian assault began in early October with over 300,000 troops.
  - Serbia, with only 250,000 men and little equipment, fell back rapidly under pressure.
- Greece refused to honour its treaty with Serbia, claiming the terms weren’t fulfilled; Allied help arrived too late.
  - French and British troops landed at Salonika but were blocked by Bulgarian advances.
## The Salonika Front and Allied Stagnation (p. 137)
- The remnants of the Serbian army retreated through Albania in winter, suffering immense losses.
  - Around 100,000 survivors were evacuated to Corfu and reconstituted.
- The Allies held Salonika with several divisions, refusing to withdraw despite its strategic irrelevance.
  - French General Maurice Sarrail entrenched his forces and engaged in Greek politics, while the Germans mockingly called the front “our largest internment camp.”
## End of the Year and Strategic Stalemate (pp. 137–139)
- Despite some territorial gains, 1915 ended in frustration for both sides.
- The Dardanelles failed, Serbia collapsed, Russia was reeling, and Italy had bogged down.
- Germany held firm on enemy soil but faced shortages from the blockade; Austria remained militarily weak and politically unstable.
- With no clear path to victory, all powers committed to an even greater effort in 1916, determined that earlier sacrifices must not be in vain.
# 11. “The Love Battles”: Verdun and the Somme
## Von Falkenhayn’s Strategy and the Choice of Verdun (p. 140)
- General von Falkenhayn, frustrated by indecisive operations in 1915, shifted strategy in 1916 toward attrition rather than breakthrough.
- He viewed France as the key Allied power on land and aimed to destroy its army at a symbolic location: [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]].
  - The goal was “to bleed France white” by forcing it into a costly defensive battle over ground it could not afford to lose.
## Allied Planning and the Somme Agreement (pp. 141–142)
- Allied commanders met at Chantilly in December 1915 to plan coordinated offensives in 1916.
  - They agreed to simultaneous attacks by all major powers to stretch German resources.
- General Joffre and General Haig met to plan a major joint offensive along the Somme River.
  - Haig preferred Flanders but agreed to the Somme as it lay where British and French forces met.
## German Assault at Verdun Begins (pp. 142–144)
- German 5th Army launched its attack on 21 February 1916 with a 12-hour artillery barrage.
- Initial advances were slowed by weather, but Fort Douaumont fell on 25 February in a surprise infiltration.
  - Morale collapsed in France; General de Castelnau was sent to stabilise the front.
  - General Philippe Pétain took command and organised a defensive system with continuous troop rotation and reliable supply.
## The Battle of Verdun Grinds On (pp. 144–146)
- Verdun became a grinding battle of attrition from February to December.
- German attacks east and west of the Meuse targeted Fort Vaux, Hill 304, and Le Mort Homme.
  - Both sides launched repeated offensives with horrific losses.
- Pétain’s “Sacred Way” supply route kept the French position alive.
  - 70% of the French Army served at Verdun at some point; the slogan “Ils ne passeront pas” became national resolve.
- The plan backfired: the French held, and the cost for Germany was severe. Von Falkenhayn was dismissed in August and replaced by General Hindenburg.
## French Counteroffensive at Verdun (pp. 146–147)
- In October, Generals Nivelle and Mangin led a counterattack with heavy artillery support.
- Fort Douaumont was retaken on 24 October; Fort Vaux fell in early November.
  - German morale eroded under pressure; French regained territory in mid-December.
- The French lost 542,000 men; Germany 434,000. The battle became a national trauma and symbol of endurance.
## The Somme Offensive Begins (pp. 147–149)
- Originally intended as a joint offensive, the Somme became a mainly British operation while France was consumed at Verdun.
- On 1 July 1916, the B.E.F. under General Haig launched its assault; General Rawlinson led the 4th Army.
- The plan relied on a massive week-long artillery bombardment intended to destroy German defences.
  - Haig hoped for cavalry exploitation; Rawlinson, cautious, favoured a “bite and hold” method using infantry control.
## Catastrophe on the First Day of the Somme (pp. 149–151)
- The bombardment failed to cut wire or suppress machine guns; German positions were largely intact.
- On 1 July, advancing British troops were mown down in huge numbers.
  - 57,470 casualties were sustained, with 19,240 dead—the worst day in British military history.
  - The Newfoundland Regiment suffered 91% casualties at Beaumont-Hamel.
  - The 10th West Yorkshires were nearly wiped out on rising ground in No Man’s Land.
## Continued Fighting and Attrition (pp. 151–153)
- Despite the losses, Haig pressed the offensive through July, August, and September.
  - Limited success came with the capture of Delville Wood and Pozières.
- German resistance was tenacious; the battle devolved into attrition, similar to Verdun.
## Introduction of the Tank (p. 153)
- Britain introduced tanks at the Battle of Flers–Courcelette on 15 September.
  - Mechanical failures plagued the deployment; only a few tanks reached their objectives.
  - Despite modest gains, the psychological impact was significant.
## Final Phase and Casualties (p. 154)
- Fighting continued through October and November, culminating in the capture of Beaumont-Hamel on 18 November.
- Casualties were staggering: 420,000 British, 195,000 French, and approximately 650,000 German.
# 12. “Another Such Victory and We Are Lost…”
## Allied Pressure and the Fifth Battle of the Isonzo (p. 157)
- Coordinated Allied offensives for 1916 were disrupted by the German attack at Verdun, forcing weaker allies to act prematurely.
- General Cadorna launched the Fifth Battle of the Isonzo on 9 March, under French pressure, despite harsh winter conditions.
  - It lasted about a week, yielded no change in the front, and resulted in high casualties on both sides, with Italians suffering more.
## The Austrian Trentino Offensive (pp. 157–158)
- General Conrad von Hötzendorf launched an independent Austrian offensive in the Trentino, aiming to knock Italy out of the war.
- Without German support, Conrad shifted 15 divisions from the Isonzo and Russian fronts, forming the 11th Army under Archduke Eugen.
  - Their target was Padua, 45 miles away, to sever Italy’s supply lines and war capacity.
- Italian intelligence detected the buildup, but General Brusato ignored Cadorna’s warnings and failed to prepare defences.
## The Battle of Asiago (pp. 158–159)
- On 15 May, the Austrians launched their attack across mountainous terrain, catching the Italian 1st Army off guard.
  - By month’s end they captured Asiago and continued advancing toward Arsiero in mid-June.
- As Russian pressure mounted on the Eastern Front, Conrad was forced to halt the offensive in June after 100,000 casualties on each side.
## The Sixth Battle of the Isonzo and Gorizia (pp. 159–160)
- Cadorna regrouped and shifted troops back to the Isonzo, exploiting interior lines.
- On 6 August, he launched the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo, also called the Battle of Gorizia.
  - Italians advanced three miles and captured Gorizia—a rare, if limited, success.
  - Cadorna followed with the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Battles through November, which resulted in high casualties and no further gains.
## Russian Setbacks and the Naroch Offensive (p. 160)
- Russia responded to French pleas by launching an offensive near Lake Naroch on 18 March.
  - It quickly bogged down due to spring mud and resulted in heavy Russian casualties with no gains.
## Brusilov’s Reform and Tactical Innovation (pp. 160–162)
- General Alexei Brusilov, recently appointed to command the Southwest Front, proposed a new offensive after Austrian gains in Italy.
- Brusilov introduced tactical reforms:
  - Short, targeted bombardments instead of mass shelling
  - Careful reconnaissance and pre-attack trench preparation
  - Use of specialised assault troops (early “shock troops”) to infiltrate defences
- This innovation avoided pulverising the battlefield and allowed for rapid movement.
## [[The Brusilov Offensive]] (pp. 162–163)
- On 4 June, Brusilov’s armies attacked along a 200-mile front from the Pripet Marshes to the Romanian border.
  - Austrians were surprised and overwhelmed; a 60-mile breach opened and advances of 25 miles followed in the first week.
  - Czernowitz fell in the south; Kowel was threatened in the north. Austria’s line crumbled.
## Limited Support and German Intervention (pp. 163–164)
- Other Russian fronts failed to launch supportive attacks, citing supply issues or religious holidays.
  - German forces remained largely unengaged in the north.
- Falkenhayn sent reinforcements, and equilibrium slowly returned. German logistics outperformed Russian supply lines.
  - Despite Russian advances, exhaustion set in by late July.
## Decline of the Offensive (pp. 164–165)
- Brusilov's forces, uncertain of their own success, resumed old methods of mass bombardment and frontal assaults.
- The offensive dragged into September and became another costly attritional battle.
  - Each side lost about a million men. Russia’s early momentum vanished.
## Strategic Consequences and Romania’s Entry (pp. 165–166)
- The offensive weakened the Central Powers in France and Italy but did not decisively alter the war.
- Romania entered the war in August, lured by promises of Transylvania and other territories.
  - Its demands delayed entry until after the offensive’s peak; Allied supply promises went unmet.
## Romanian Campaign and Defeat (pp. 166–167)
- Romania attacked Austria rather than Bulgaria, aiming for territorial gain.
  - Falkenhayn led German forces from Transylvania; Mackensen attacked from the south with Bulgarian support.
  - Romania’s seaport was lost; pincer attacks cut off forces; the country was effectively occupied by January 1917.
  - Romanian casualties were 300,000–400,000; the Central Powers lost far fewer.
## Rise of German Control and Russian Collapse (p. 167)
- Austria’s inability to win unaided led Germany to take full operational control of the war effort.
  - Hindenburg and Ludendorff now dominated Central Powers’ strategy and increasingly, their allies’ governments.
- Russia, despite initial gains, was left exhausted. The Brusilov Offensive was its final major effort.
  - Desertion, low morale, and political disintegration followed. The monarchy’s days were visibly numbered by late 1916.
# 13. The Navy Gets Its Chance
## Stalemate at Sea and the Push for Action (p. 168)
- The Royal Navy and the German High Seas Fleet remained in a prolonged stalemate, each avoiding decisive action.
- Britain controlled the seas and maintained the blockade, but public and political pressure demanded visible results.
  - German U-boats harassed shipping but avoided surface fleet battles; the Kaiser refused to risk his ships in open combat.
## Change in German Command and Strategy (pp. 168–169)
- In January 1916, Admiral von Pohl was replaced by Admiral Reinhard Scheer, a more aggressive commander.
- With the war stalemated on land and pressure mounting, the Kaiser relaxed restrictions on naval operations.
  - Scheer planned to use surface raids to lure the British into battle while submarines ambushed them.
## Early Skirmishes and Missed Opportunities (pp. 169–170)
- In April, German battlecruisers shelled Lowestoft, but weather prevented follow-up attacks.
- British attempts to provoke action, such as a seaplane raid, failed due to poor conditions.
- Scheer planned a Sunderland raid in May, but weather and the expiration of U-boat positions forced a change of plans.
## Fleets Move Toward Jutland (pp. 170–171)
- Both Scheer and Admiral Jellicoe independently planned sweeps into the North Sea near southern Norway.
- The British intercepted increased German signals and prepared for battle. Jellicoe sailed with 24 dreadnoughts and supporting ships; Admiral Beatty followed with the Battle Cruiser Fleet.
- On 31 May, Admiral Hipper led five German battlecruisers ahead of the High Seas Fleet; Scheer followed with the main body.
## First Contact and the Run to the South (pp. 171–173)
- A chance sighting by the cruiser Galatea of a German destroyer near a Danish merchant ship triggered the battle.
  - If Beatty had turned earlier, the British might have caught the Germans farther north.
- Beatty engaged Hipper in the “run to the south”; the British had more powerful ships but were disorganised.
  - The Fifth Battle Squadron under Admiral Evan-Thomas was trailing and slow to join the fight.
- Indefatigable exploded under German fire at 4:04 P.M., followed by Queen Mary twenty minutes later.
  - Beatty famously remarked, “There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today.”
## Run to the North and British Deployment (pp. 173–175)
- Realising Scheer’s fleet was approaching, Beatty reversed course to draw the Germans toward Jellicoe.
  - His turn was poorly executed, leaving Evan-Thomas's ships exposed.
- Jellicoe deployed his battleships into line at 6:15 P.M., successfully “crossing the T” of the German fleet.
  - The Germans emerged from the mist to face the full arc of British firepower.
- The armoured cruisers Defence and Warrior were destroyed by massed German fire; Invincible exploded shortly after being hit midships.
## German Withdrawal and Tactical Escape (pp. 175–176)
- Hipper’s battlecruisers were devastated; Lützow was sinking, and Hipper was forced to shift command by destroyer.
- Scheer, trapped and facing annihilation, executed a perfectly timed “battle turn away,” reversing course under fire.
  - German destroyers and smoke screens covered the withdrawal.
- A second encounter occurred just after 7 P.M., but light and confusion prevented full engagement.
  - Another “battle turn away” and a desperate torpedo assault by light forces allowed temporary escape.
## Night Maneuvering and British Missed Opportunity (pp. 176–177)
- Scheer attempted to cross the British rear during the night to return home; Jellicoe positioned the Grand Fleet to block them at dawn.
- The Germans slipped through under cover of darkness, fighting scattered night battles with British destroyers and cruisers.
  - Communications failed; many British commanders assumed the fighting astern was minor.
  - By morning, the Grand Fleet found only debris and no enemy.
## Reactions and Strategic Consequences (pp. 177–178)
- The German press claimed a material victory, citing comparative losses: Britain lost 14 ships, Germany 11.
- The British argued they held the field and retained strategic control of the sea.
  - Jutland did not alter naval dominance; the blockade remained intact.
  - A writer noted that the High Seas Fleet had “assaulted its jailers, but was now safely back behind bars.”
## Aftermath and Legacy (pp. 178–179)
- Public reaction in Britain was bitterly disappointed; they had expected a Trafalgar, not a costly stalemate.
- Post-Jutland reforms included better shells, magazine protection, and communications.
  - Beatty replaced Jellicoe in command of the Grand Fleet; Jellicoe became First Sea Lord.
- Jutland marked the end of an era in naval warfare: the last great surface battle without subs, aircraft, or missiles.
  - Like other WWI battles, it was marked by over-complexity, misjudgement, and indecision.
# 14. Imperial Wars and Colonial Campaigns
## Imperial Motivations and Strategic Spoils (p. 180)
- Many secondary nations joined the war seeking territorial gain—adjacent or colonial—including Bulgaria, Romania, Japan, Italy, and Greece.
- The Ottoman Empire’s entry into the war helped the Allies offer promises of Turkish territory to lure new partners.
- Germany’s overseas empire was extensive but poorly defensible due to its limited naval power.
  - German strategy focused on dominating Europe and bargaining for colonial gains after a continental victory.
## British Colonial Campaigns and German Possessions (pp. 180–181)
- Britain, still able to project power overseas despite Western Front demands, took the lead in colonial operations.
- German colonies in the Pacific fell quickly:
  - Japan declared war on 23 August 1914 and seized the fortress at Tsingtao after a siege lasting until 7 November.
    - The battle involved early examples of naval bombardment and aerial bombing.
  - Japan also occupied the Marianas, Carolines, and Marshalls; New Zealand took Samoa, and Australia took northeastern New Guinea and nearby islands.
## Campaigns in Africa: Togoland and the Cameroons (pp. 181–182)
- Togoland surrendered on 26 August 1914 to Anglo-French forces.
- The Cameroons campaign was prolonged due to climate and terrain.
  - Duala fell in September 1914; German forces retreated inland to Yaunde.
  - The garrison escaped into Spanish Rio Muni in 1916, tying up massive Allied manpower and resources.
## German Southwest Africa and Boer Unrest (pp. 182–183)
- German Southwest Africa was targeted by South Africa, but internal resistance complicated operations.
  - Some Afrikaners sympathised with Germany and rebelled.
  - South African General Louis Botha led the suppression of the uprising and then a converging offensive on Windhoek.
  - Germans surrendered in July 1915 after being pushed back to Otavi.
## German East Africa and von Lettow-Vorbeck (pp. 183–185)
- German East Africa, under General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, proved the most elusive and resilient German colony.
  - His small force (approx. 15,000) conducted guerrilla warfare and tied down over 300,000 Allied troops and porters.
- Early British efforts, including the Tanga landing in October 1914, were a disaster.
  - British troops landed in a swamp, met stiff resistance, and retreated—later taxed for their salvaged supplies.
- British, Belgian, and Portuguese forces converged over time, and Jan Smuts led a major campaign from 1916.
  - By late 1917 most German troops were captured, but von Lettow-Vorbeck escaped into Mozambique.
  - He surrendered only in November 1918, two weeks after the armistice.
## The Russian–Turkish War in the Caucasus (pp. 185–187)
- Enver Pasha led Turkish forces into the Caucasus but suffered disaster at Sarikamis in winter 1914–15.
  - Temperatures dropped to –55°C; the Turkish army was reduced from 95,000 to 18,000.
- General Nikolai Yudenich led successful Russian counterattacks in 1916, capturing Erzerum and Trebizond.
- Russian gains stalled as their army disintegrated in 1917; the Turks regained ground and resumed massacres of Armenians.
## Mesopotamian Campaign and the Fall of Kut (pp. 187–189)
- Britain, motivated by oil interests and imperial rivalry, launched a campaign from the Persian Gulf.
  - General Sir John Nixon and General Charles Townshend advanced to Basra and up the Tigris to Kut.
- Townshend defeated the Turks at Kut in September 1915, then advanced toward Baghdad under political pressure.
  - He was repulsed at Ctesiphon and besieged at Kut by Turkish forces under General von der Goltz.
- Three failed British relief attempts ended in April 1916; Townshend surrendered 10,000 men—the largest British surrender until Singapore in 1942.
## Sinai and Palestine Front: Gaza and Imperial Politics (pp. 189–191)
- British forces, worried about the Suez Canal, pushed eastward into Sinai under General Archibald Murray in 1916.
- The first and second battles of Gaza (March–April 1917) failed due to poor staff work and leadership.
  - Murray and General C. M. Dobell were replaced; General Edmund Allenby took command.
  - Meanwhile, Arab tribes began to rise against the Ottomans with support from T. E. Lawrence.
## Imperial Promises and Conflicting Agreements (pp. 191–193)
- Britain recognised Ibn Saud’s authority in the Gulf in December 1915, then backed his rival Hussein, Sherif of Mecca, in 1916.
  - Hussein declared himself “King of the Arabs”; Britain recognised him only as King of the Hejaz.
- The 1916 [[Sykes–Picot Agreement]] divided the Ottoman Middle East into British and French spheres.
- The 1917 [[St. Jean de Maurienne Agreement]] promised Italy part of southwestern Anatolia.
- The [[Balfour Declaration]] (November 1917) endorsed “a national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine.
  - Its ambiguous phrasing caused deep controversy between Arabs and Jews that extended far beyond the war.
# 15. The Nadir of the War
## Collapse of Morale and Material Shortages (p. 194)
- The winter of 1916–17, known as the “turnip winter,” saw dire shortages and widespread hardship across Europe.
- War consumed massive resources without production in return, depleting both industry and manpower.
  - Nearly every family had lost someone; the longer the war dragged on, the more unreachable peace seemed.
- Soldiers at the front grew disillusioned and embittered, directing their anger at civilians and staff officers rather than enemy troops.
## France in Crisis and the Rise of Clemenceau (pp. 195–196)
- France was near exhaustion: its best industrial areas were occupied, losses were staggering, and discontent was rising.
- Political unity under the *union sacrée* began to unravel, with public criticism targeting Premier Briand and even General Joffre.
  - Joffre was reassigned in December 1916 and made a Marshal of France; General Robert Nivelle replaced him on the Western Front.
- Georges Clemenceau, “The Tiger,” became the leading voice for relentless war; he denounced all weakness and demanded total victory.
## French Political Reshuffling and Nivelle’s Promise (p. 196)
- Premier Briand resigned in March 1917; Alexandre Ribot became Prime Minister and Paul Painlevé took over the War Ministry.
- Nivelle promised a decisive offensive that would end the war.
  - France had already lost over 3 million men, nearly 1 million of them dead.
## British Political Upheaval and the Easter Rising (pp. 196–197)
- Britain entered the war unprepared for continental-scale fighting but gradually adapted through coalition and committee government.
- In April 1916, Irish nationalists staged the Easter Rising in Dublin, aided nominally by Germany.
  - Sir Roger Casement tried to halt it but failed; the rising was suppressed in four days and its leaders were executed.
- Political turmoil deepened after military failures and Kitchener’s death; criticism led to Asquith’s resignation in December 1916.
  - David Lloyd George became Prime Minister, forming a coalition of radical Liberals and hardline Conservatives.
## Russia’s Slide Toward Collapse (pp. 197–199)
- Tsar Nicholas II appointed Boris Stürmer as Prime Minister in February 1916; he was deeply unpopular and linked to Rasputin.
  - Stürmer purged reformers and ruled via repression with Tsarina Alexandra’s backing.
- In November, public protest forced Nicholas to dismiss Stürmer, only to replace him with the equally reactionary Alexander Trepov.
- Strikes, desertions, and breakdowns in industry, transport, and communication signalled the state’s impending collapse.
  - Even aristocrats and former monarchists began plotting against the Tsar’s inner circle.
## The Murder of Rasputin (pp. 199–200)
- Prince Felix Yusupov and other nobles murdered Rasputin on the night of 29–30 December 1916.
  - Poison, bullets, bludgeoning, and drowning were all required to kill him.
- The Tsarina mourned Rasputin and ignored warnings. His prophecy haunted her: “If I die or you desert me, your son and your throne will not last six months.”
## The Death of Franz Josef and Austria’s Weakening Position (pp. 200–201)
- Emperor Franz Josef died on 21 November 1916; he had become a powerless figurehead.
- His successor, [[Charles I]], was earnest but weak. Empress Zita was seen as ambitious but ineffective.
  - Charles sought peace but was constrained by German dominance over Austria’s military and government.
  - A pre-approved Austrian peace proposal was watered down by Berlin into meaningless rhetoric and rejected by the Allies.
## German Militarisation of Government and War Aims (pp. 201–202)
- Hindenburg and Ludendorff took effective control of the German Empire, sidelining Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg.
  - The economy was already mobilised by Walther Rathenau’s War Materials Office.
  - Germany's internal democracy was eroding; the Reichstag began challenging war policy but had little actual power.
## Decision for Unrestricted Submarine Warfare (pp. 202–203)
- Facing stalemate on land and blockade at sea, Germany debated lifting naval restraints.
  - Bethmann-Hollweg opposed unrestricted submarine warfare, fearing U.S. entry into the war.
  - The Admiralty promised to sink 600,000 tons of shipping per month and starve Britain into surrender within six months.
- On 12 December 1916, Germany offered vague peace terms via the U.S.; the Allies rejected them and issued harsh counter-demands on 10 January 1917.
  - On 8 January, Germany had already decided on unrestricted submarine warfare, believing the U.S. could not intervene in time.
# 16. The Collapse of Russia
## Revolution in Petrograd (p. 204)
- After the failure of Brusilov’s offensive, the Eastern Front remained quiet into early 1917, but domestic unrest erupted first.
- On 8 March 1917 (International Women's Day), food riots in Petrograd escalated due to hunger, discontent, and poor conditions.
  - Crowds grew over three days; on 10 March the garrison refused to suppress the demonstrations and instead joined them.
- On 11 March, Tsar Nicholas II dissolved the Duma, but it reassembled independently and began forming a Temporary Committee.
## Collapse of Authority and Abdication (pp. 205–206)
- Mutiny spread rapidly; soldiers created their own “soviets” and attacked their officers.
- A Provisional Government was formed on 12 March, led by Prince George Lvov and including Alexander Kerensky as Minister of Justice.
  - Simultaneously, the Petrograd Soviet emerged as a rival center of power.
- On 15 March, Nicholas abdicated in favour of his brother, Grand Duke Michael, who also abdicated the next day in favour of the Provisional Government.
## The Provisional Government’s Challenges (pp. 206–207)
- The new regime abolished discrimination, recognised Polish independence, and promised land redistribution and social reform.
  - These efforts failed to gain public confidence; the Duma politicians were viewed as tied to the old regime.
- Continued support for the war deeply undermined the government's credibility, despite Allied approval.
  - Kerensky became Minister of War in May and planned a new offensive with General Brusilov.
## Order No. 1 and the Collapse of the Army (pp. 207–208)
- On 14 March, the Petrograd Soviet issued Order No. 1, effectively abolishing the traditional military hierarchy.
  - Officers lost authority; soldiers formed committees and stopped obeying orders.
- Desertion surged, and discipline vanished. The army disintegrated under the twin pressures of war-weariness and radical propaganda.
  - The slogan “Peace, land, bread” resonated more than calls for loyalty.
## [[Kerensky Offensive]] and Bolshevik Rising (pp. 208–209)
- In early July, Brusilov launched a final offensive using politically reliable troops; initial success around Lemberg faded quickly.
- A German counteroffensive in late July rolled back gains and prompted the Bolsheviks' first coup attempt.
  - Lenin, returned to Russia by Germany in April, called for a “proletarian” revolution and began separating the Bolsheviks from other socialist groups.
## Lenin’s Return and Rise (pp. 209–210)
- Lenin, sent in a sealed train by Germany, arrived in April and quickly took control of the Bolshevik movement.
- Trotsky, arrested in Halifax en route from New York, was later released and became Lenin’s deputy and architect of the Red Army.
- In July, Lenin attempted a premature coup; it failed, and he fled to Finland.
## Political Fragmentation and Kornilov Affair (pp. 210–211)
- Nationalist regions declared independence, and Cossacks formed their own regime.
- General Lavr Kornilov, dismissed by Kerensky, attempted a military coup in September.
  - Troops deserted, and the Bolsheviks—newly freed—helped suppress him, increasing their popularity.
## Bolshevik Seizure of Power (p. 211)
- In October, the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the Petrograd Soviet; Trotsky was elected chairman.
- On 6 November, Lenin and the Bolsheviks seized control in Petrograd. The Provisional Government fell with minimal resistance.
  - On 7 November, the Congress of Soviets ratified the coup. Russia entered a period of civil war.
## Armistice and Brest-Litovsk (pp. 212–213)
- Lenin immediately offered Germany an armistice. The Riga offensive in September had already weakened the Provisional Government.
- Germany used “Hutier tactics” during the offensive—brief bombardment, infiltration, coordination—setting the model for 1918 offensives.
- The Bolsheviks met the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk in December 1917 to discuss peace.
## Harsh German Terms and Renewed Advance (pp. 213–214)
- Germany demanded independence for all border states, economic concessions, and territorial cessions.
  - Trotsky stalled but ultimately could not resist; German forces advanced toward Petrograd in February 1918.
- On 10 February, Trotsky declared the war over without signing a treaty; Germany resumed its advance.
## Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (p. 215)
- With no functioning army, Russia conceded. On 3 March 1918, Trotsky signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].
  - Germany gained vast territories, resources, and freed forces for the Western Front.
  - This delay arguably cost Germany a decisive chance to win in the West before the U.S. fully arrived.
# 17. The Submarine Campaign; The United States Enters the War
## German Submarine Strategy and U.S. Restraint (p. 216)
- By late 1916, Germany believed it could win the war but was being slowed by political caution—particularly due to U.S. objections to submarine warfare.
- Germany had restricted U-boat use after U.S. protests in 1915 (Lusitania, Arabic incidents) and introduced new policies requiring passenger ships to be warned.
- Admiral von Tirpitz resigned in protest at continued caution; unrestricted warfare was resumed only in limited areas.
## The Sussex Pledge and Temporary Restraint (pp. 216–217)
- After UB-29 sank the Sussex in March 1916, the U.S. issued a strong warning. Germany issued the “Sussex pledge,” agreeing to restrict submarine warfare once more.
  - Submarines shifted to the Mediterranean or supported the fleet (e.g., at Jutland) but lost much effectiveness.
- British blockade tightened; German frustration with U.S. interference grew, especially as American military strength appeared negligible.
## German Misjudgment of U.S. Capability (pp. 217–219)
- Germany viewed the U.S. as militarily irrelevant—110,000 troops, poor equipment, and internal divisions.
  - The army had no tanks, few planes, and could barely contain Pancho Villa in Mexico.
- U.S. war plans were undeveloped; Wilson even ordered them halted to avoid appearing provocative.
  - Germany underestimated U.S. industrial and financial capacity, focusing only on military strength.
## Germany Declares Unrestricted Submarine Warfare (p. 219)
- Germany believed U.S. restraint had held it back from victory. On 31 January 1917, it announced unrestricted submarine warfare would resume on 1 February.
- President Wilson, increasingly alienated by Europe's war aims, broke diplomatic ties on 3 February but waited for a clear act of aggression before declaring war.
## The Zimmermann Telegram and U.S. Reaction (pp. 220–221)
- On 16 January 1917, British intelligence intercepted a telegram from German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann to Mexico, proposing an alliance and return of U.S. territory.
  - Britain released it to the U.S. on 25 February, enraging American public opinion, especially in the West.
- Even so, Wilson held back; when Congress refused to authorise arming merchant ships, he did so by executive order.
## U.S. Enters the War (p. 221)
- In March, German submarines sank four U.S. ships, killing 36 Americans. Wilson went to Congress on 2 April 1917.
  - On 6 April, Congress declared war. Wilson stated, “The world must be made safe for democracy.”
- The U.S. joined the war just as the Allies were nearing collapse and German submarine warfare peaked.
## Submarine Warfare Peaks (pp. 221–222)
- In early 1917, Germany had ~120 submarines, able to keep ~80 operational. In February, 500,000 tons of shipping were sunk; in March, 750,000; in April, 875,000.
  - One in four ships leaving Britain was lost. Rear Admiral Sims, upon seeing British figures, declared, “We are losing the war.”
## The Convoy System and U-boat Decline (pp. 222–223)
- Convoys had long been resisted by British Admiralty, but Sims’ support and mounting losses forced a trial.
  - The first convoy (from Gibraltar) arrived safely on 20 May; by September, convoying was standard, and losses declined.
- New antisubmarine tech included depth charges, hydrophones, and Channel/Adriatic mine barrages.
  - The Zeebrugge Raid and the Otranto Barrage restricted U-boat operations further.
## Financial War and U.S. Credit (pp. 223–224)
- German leaders failed to grasp the effect of U.S. financial power. War spending reached $224 million/day by 1918.
  - There wasn’t enough gold in the world to finance it; all sides turned to credit and borrowing.
- Britain’s national debt rose from £625 million to £7.8 billion. U.S. lending was critical by 1917.
  - The U.S. provided $9.5 billion in loans to the Allies—likely more decisive than American soldiers.
## Early U.S. Mobilisation and Pershing (pp. 224–226)
- The first Americans arrived in June 1917 with General John J. Pershing; combat deployment began in October.
  - The 1st Division was undertrained, with many raw recruits; training and organisation took time.
- Pershing resisted British and French efforts to integrate U.S. troops into their units, insisting on an independent American army.
  - This preserved national identity but caused tension, especially as the Allies were desperate for reinforcements while the U.S. was still preparing to fight.
# 18. The Western Front, 1917
## Strategic Planning and Political Turmoil (p. 227)
- Allied leaders met in November 1916 and planned coordinated attacks on all fronts, with the Western Front still the main effort.
- General Joffre proposed a French attack on the Oise followed by a British coastal offensive.
- Political changes soon disrupted these plans:
  - In Britain, David Lloyd George became Prime Minister and clashed with General Haig.
  - In France, General Robert Nivelle replaced Joffre, impressing politicians with a bold promise to win the war in 48 hours using “violence, brutality, and rapidity.”
## Nivelle’s Offensive Plan and British Resistance (pp. 228–229)
- Nivelle proposed a massive French assault on the Chemin des Dames, supported by a British diversion at Arras.
  - Lloyd George backed Nivelle, even offering full British cooperation—infuriating Haig and General Robertson.
- British leaders resisted subordination to French command and managed to dilute the agreement, keeping operational independence.
- Haig planned his own major attack in Flanders, with preliminary operations to precede it.
## German Strategic Withdrawal and the Hindenburg Line (pp. 229–230)
- Expecting success from their submarine campaign, the Germans adopted a defensive posture in the West.
- They withdrew from a 50-mile stretch to shorten lines and created the heavily fortified Siegfriedstellung (Hindenburg Line).
  - In their retreat, they destroyed infrastructure and left a scorched-earth wasteland.
- This withdrawal exposed positions at Arras and the Aisne—exactly where the Allies would strike.
## The Battle of Arras and Vimy Ridge (pp. 230–231)
- On 9 April 1917, the British launched their attack at Arras, aiming to seize Vimy Ridge and advance up the Scarpe River.
- The Canadian Corps under General Sir Julian Byng led the assault on [[Assault on Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]], achieving a major success.
  - The capture of Vimy was a landmark Canadian victory and symbol of national identity.
  - Meticulous planning, thorough bombardment, and tactical innovation were key.
## Aftermath of Arras (pp. 231–232)
- To the south, the British advanced modestly along the Scarpe, but German resistance stiffened.
- Haig allowed the offensive to taper off as he shifted focus to Messines and Passchendaele.
## The Nivelle Offensive and French Collapse (pp. 232–235)
- On 16 April, Nivelle launched the Second Battle of the Aisne with 1.2 million troops and 7,000 guns.
- The Germans were fully prepared:
  - Aircraft superiority allowed them to blind French artillery spotters.
  - Infantry struggled through rain-slick terrain, losing coordination with their barrage.
  - German machine guns decimated French attackers.
- Despite heavy losses, Nivelle persisted. On 5 May, his troops gained the Chemin des Dames Ridge—but at enormous cost.
  - French losses: 120,000 men; morale collapsed.
## The French Army Mutinies (pp. 235–236)
- Pétain replaced Nivelle on 15 May and found the army on the brink of mutiny.
  - Soldiers refused to attack; regiments baa-ed at their generals like sheep to the slaughter.
- Causes included:
  - Overuse of veterans and underage recruits
  - Lack of rest, pay, and family support
  - Brutal discipline and poor leadership outside combat
- Mutiny spread rapidly; half the French army was affected. Pétain restored order through:
  - Personal visits and promises of reform
  - Harsh disciplinary action: 23,000 punished, 432 sentenced to death (55 executed)
- The mutinies were kept secret; the Germans never exploited the opportunity.
## Strategic Consequences for France (pp. 236–237)
- Though the army continued to hold the line, its offensive capacity was broken.
- Pétain focused on rebuilding morale and preparing for an eventual American arrival.
## Battle of Messines Ridge (pp. 237–238)
- In June, Haig launched a successful assault on Messines Ridge, a key German position south of Ypres.
  - General Plumer used deep mines, packed with nearly 1 million pounds of explosives, to obliterate German lines.
  - The attack was a tactical success and restored British morale.
## Preparations for Third Ypres (Passchendaele) (pp. 238–240)
- Haig now aimed to clear the Belgian coast via a three-phase plan: breakthrough near Ypres, amphibious landing, and advance toward Ghent.
- General Gough’s 5th Army was assigned to lead, supported by Plumer and French forces.
- Terrain around Ypres was poor—clayey, flat, with destroyed drainage systems. Rain would prove disastrous.
## The Battle of Passchendaele (pp. 240–242)
- On 31 July, the British launched their offensive under heavy bombardment.
  - Initial gains were modest, but rain began the next day and turned the battlefield to mud.
- Soldiers drowned in waterlogged shell holes; supply and evacuation became impossible.
  - Duckboards were laid across the mud but offered little relief under fire.
- Gough’s offensive stalled; Haig shifted command to Plumer, who made slow but steady progress with limited attacks.
- In November, the Canadians finally captured Passchendaele village.
  - British gains: ~4.5 miles at a cost of 250,000 casualties.
## The End of the “Love Battles” (p. 243)
- Passchendaele marked the end of mass, faith-based offensives driven by patriotic conviction.
- Casualties, disillusionment, and changing tactics made battles like the Somme or Verdun increasingly obsolete.
- As tactics evolved and the U.S. entered the war, both sides prepared for a decisive new phase in 1918.
# 19. Change and Continuity
## Strategic Stalemate and Shifting Expectations (p. 243)
- By late 1917, both sides were exhausted but still seeking victory.
- Allied leaders like Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and Orlando were determined to press on, especially with U.S. help arriving.
- Germany saw unrestricted submarine warfare as a strategic error:
  - Britain had not been starved.
  - U.S. military involvement was now growing.
  - The Allies would win through sheer numbers if the war continued.
## Russian Collapse and German Opportunity (p. 244)
- With Russia out of the war, Germany could shift forces westward.
- A brief window of advantage opened—Germany hoped to win in spring 1918 before U.S. power fully arrived.
## Disaster at Caporetto (pp. 244–247)
- Italy launched the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo in August 1917 with 51 divisions and over 5,000 guns.
  - Gains were minimal, but Austrian lines were strained.
- Ludendorff created a new 14th Army under General Otto von Below, including five German divisions, to break the deadlock.
- On 24 October, using Hutier tactics, Germans and Austrians launched a surprise attack at Caporetto:
  - Infiltration teams bypassed strongpoints; communication collapsed.
  - Italian 2nd Army disintegrated; massive retreat followed.
  - By 3 November, Germans crossed the Tagliamento; Italian retreat continued to the Piave River, 75 miles back.
  - Over 40,000 casualties, 275,000 prisoners, and 2,500 guns lost.
  - Lieutenant Erwin Rommel captured 8,000 prisoners at Longarone with minimal losses.
## Allied Response and the Supreme War Council (p. 247)
- The Caporetto disaster forced Allied coordination.
- Foch brought six Anglo-French divisions to Italy.
- The Allies created a Supreme War Council in Paris to coordinate future operations—an early step toward unified command.
## Cambrai and the Debut of Tanks (pp. 247–249)
- On 20 November 1917, the British launched the Battle of Cambrai using ~350 tanks.
- Lieutenant Colonel J.F.C. Fuller designed the plan; Cambrai was chosen for its firm terrain.
- General Byng’s 3rd Army attacked without preliminary bombardment:
  - Artillery used new sound-ranging and flash-spotting techniques for accuracy.
  - Tanks crushed wire, supported infantry, and achieved early breakthroughs.
  - At Flesquières, the 51st Highland Division deviated from the plan, causing a delay and allowing German defenses to regroup.
## German Counterattack and Tactical Evolution (p. 249)
- On 30 November, Germans counterattacked using infiltration tactics, retaking much of the lost ground.
- The battle ended in early December; both sides learned new operational lessons.
  - British tanks saved Gouzeaucourt; warfare was evolving past static attrition.
## The Rise of Air Power (pp. 250–253)
- Airplanes became tactically vital by 1917, expanding war into a third dimension.
- Initially used for reconnaissance and artillery spotting; aerial combat evolved rapidly:
  - Interrupter gear (pioneered by Anthony Fokker) allowed machine guns to fire through propellers.
  - The "Fokker scourge" gave Germany temporary air superiority in 1916.
- Famous aircraft and pilots emerged:
  - Germany: Manfred von Richthofen (“Red Baron”), Hermann Göring
  - France: Guynemer, Nungesser (Nieuport Scouts)
  - Britain: William Bishop (Sopwith Camel), S.E.5 squadrons
## Bombing and Strategic Aviation (p. 253)
- Both sides developed bombers: Zeppelins, Gothas (Germany); Handley Pages (Britain).
- Bombing campaigns began against cities and factories, but had limited strategic effect.
- The Royal Air Force (RAF) was formed on 1 April 1918.
## Allenby’s Campaign in Palestine and the Fall of Jerusalem (pp. 254–256)
- General Allenby took command in Egypt in June 1917 and revitalised British efforts.
- He attacked Beersheba on 31 October with a surprise cavalry charge by the Australians.
- Gaza fell on 6 November; Turks retreated to Junction Station.
- Allenby captured Jerusalem on 9 December after a series of drives through Judea.
  - General Falkenhayn arrived too late to stop the British advance.
## The Americans Arrive (p. 256)
- By late 1917, ~250,000 U.S. soldiers were in France.
- Equipment and training lagged—U.S. forces relied on Allied gear and were still learning trench warfare.
- The 1st Division entered a quiet sector near Luneville to gain experience.
  - Small skirmishes and German trench raids tested American readiness.
- By spring 1918, U.S. troops were still largely untested, and Pershing was more focused on maintaining independence from Allied command than engaging in combat.
# 20. The German Spring Offensives, 1918
## The Strategic Situation in Early 1918 (pp. 259–260)
- By spring, Russia was out of the war and Germany was redeploying troops westward.
- Conditions in Central and Eastern Europe were unstable: Ukrainian independence, unrest in Austria-Hungary, and Allied moves in Russia.
- Germany faced severe shortages and relied on the exploitation of occupied territories; the population was suffering.
- Britain and France remained determined despite hardships; the U.S. was enthusiastic and gearing up for a greater role.
## German Strategic Dilemma and the Decision to Attack (pp. 260–262)
- Ludendorff needed to strike before American reinforcements arrived in force.
- He chose the Somme front for the attack, seeing British forces as weaker and more brittle than the French.
  - Objective: break the British and force France out through isolation.
- German forces: 3 armies—Hutier’s 18th, von der Marwitz’s 2nd, and von Below’s 17th.
## Operation Michael: The First Offensive Begins (pp. 263–265)
- On 21 March 1918, Germans launched a massive bombardment followed by stormtrooper infiltration under heavy fog and gas.
- Gough’s 5th Army was overwhelmed; command and communication collapsed.
  - German forces broke through and advanced rapidly, targeting the Somme and Amiens.
- Allied coordination crisis followed—Haig, Pétain, and Foch met at Doullens on 26 March.
  - Haig accepted Foch’s coordination, later extended to full command.
## Collapse and Stabilisation (pp. 266–267)
- Hutier’s advance reached Montdidier, 40 miles deep, but supply lines were overstretched and German momentum stalled.
- By 1 April, the offensive ground to a halt; Ludendorff’s tactical victory brought strategic consolidation among the Allies.
- The German breakthrough had driven a wedge between French and British forces, risking coalition collapse.
## Second Offensive: The Battle of the Lys (pp. 267–269)
- On 9 April, Ludendorff attacked in Flanders near Armentières, exploiting weak sectors held by the Portuguese and overstretched British.
  - Germans broke through quickly; Plumer and Horne’s armies were pushed back.
- British morale was shaken; Haig issued his famous “backs to the wall” order.
- German advance slowed by air attacks and terrain; French reinforcements arrived in time.
  - The offensive failed to achieve its breakthrough and ended in attritional fighting.
## Consequences and Internal Tensions (pp. 269–270)
- German troops were demoralised by Allied abundance and their own deprivation.
- Behind French lines, unrest led to deployment of cavalry to deter strikes; Clemenceau refused to tolerate mutinous sentiment.
- Lloyd George continued to clash with Haig and questioned the focus on the Western Front.
## Third Offensive: The Aisne and Chemin des Dames (pp. 271–273)
- Ludendorff launched a surprise assault on 27 May, exploiting weak French and resting British divisions.
  - Bruchmüller led the artillery; the ridge was pulverised and quickly overrun.
- German troops reached the Marne by early June, capturing Soissons and threatening Paris.
## Limits of German Success (pp. 274–275)
- Momentum slowed due to supply issues, narrow penetration width, and Allied stiffening.
- U.S. troops entered action in force for the first time:
  - The 1st Division fought at Montdidier; the 3rd held the Marne at Château-Thierry.
  - The 2nd Division (U.S. Marines) fought a costly but symbolic battle at Belleau Wood.
## Tensions over American Command (pp. 275–276)
- Pershing resisted Allied efforts to integrate U.S. troops into their command structures.
- At the June Versailles meeting, he insisted on building an independent American army even if it risked Allied collapse.
  - Foch and Haig reluctantly conceded after seeing American determination and performance.
## Fourth Offensive: Montdidier–Noyon (pp. 277–278)
- On 9 June, Hutier attacked again but found French forces better prepared.
  - German gains were minor; French counterattacks stabilised the front.
- German initiative was faltering; the tide was turning toward the Allies.
## Fifth Offensive: The Second Battle of the Marne (pp. 278–279)
- On 15 July, Ludendorff launched an attack near Reims with 52 divisions.
  - The Allies had forewarning from deserters and countered with a pre-emptive barrage.
- Despite localized gains, the Germans failed to break through.
  - U.S. 3rd Division earned the title “Rock of the Marne” for its tenacious defence.
## German Collapse and Final Assessment (p. 280)
- Ludendorff’s five offensives cost ~600,000 men and gained little of strategic value.
- He had overextended his lines and depleted elite troops.
- Hindenburg, asked what Germany should do next, reportedly replied: “Make peace, you idiot!”
# 21. Allied Counteroffensive
## The Turning Point and Foch’s Strategic Plan (pp. 281–282)
- After failing to achieve a decisive victory, Germany lost its final offensive momentum by mid-July 1918.
- General [[Ferdinand Foch]], now Marshal of France, initiated a counteroffensive beginning on 18 July at Soissons.
  - The Aisne-Marne counterattack involved French, British, American, and Italian troops.
  - Over 300 French tanks supported the offensive, marking their largest use of armour in the war.
  - Americans received their first real combat experience in sustained operations.
    - The terrain and German resistance tested U.S. troops; they suffered heavy casualties but gained valuable experience.
- The Germans were forced to cancel their planned Flanders offensive and move to the defensive.
## Clearing the German Salients (pp. 282–283)
- Foch’s first goal was to eliminate three salients: around the Marne, near Amiens, and the long-standing St. Mihiel salient.
- The 18 July offensive pushed Germans back to the Vesle by 3 August; it boosted Allied morale and earned Foch his marshal’s baton.
- Pershing received command of the new U.S. 1st Army, ensuring American operational autonomy.
## The Battle of Amiens and German Collapse (pp. 283–284)
- On 8 August, a surprise Anglo-French offensive began near Amiens.
  - British 4th Army (with Canadians and Australians) used 600 tanks and no preparatory bombardment.
  - The fog initially hindered coordination, but by day’s end, the Allies had advanced up to nine miles.
  - 16,000 Germans surrendered on the first day alone.
- Ludendorff called 8 August “the black day of the German army” due to the psychological impact of mass surrenders and collapse.
- Follow-up attacks led to further gains at Peronne and north toward Arras; German morale continued to deteriorate.
## The St. Mihiel Offensive (pp. 285–286)
- The U.S. 1st Army, activated on 10 August, took over the sector including the St. Mihiel salient.
- Pershing planned to eliminate the salient and then push toward Metz.
  - Haig convinced Foch to limit the operation and shift American forces for a broader envelopment of German rail supply lines.
- On 12 September, Pershing’s attack began with three American corps and a French colonial corps.
  - The Germans were already withdrawing, but American and French forces achieved rapid success.
  - Within two days the salient was gone, 15,000 prisoners and 250 guns captured.
  - Allied high command halted the advance, missing a chance to press further while German lines were open.
## The Meuse–Argonne Offensive (pp. 287–290)
- Launched on 26 September as part of Foch’s grand strategy to cut German rail links at Aulnoye and Mézières.
- The U.S. 1st Army advanced between the Meuse River and the Argonne Forest, supported by French 4th Army under General Gouraud.
  - Terrain included fortified hills, dense woods, and narrow valleys; German resistance was fierce.
  - American troops were largely inexperienced, and progress was slow and costly.
  - Notable episode: “The Lost Battalion” (308th Infantry, 77th Division) held out for five days behind enemy lines in the Argonne.
- By 10 October, Americans reached the northern end of the forest and began breaking into open country.
- Pershing was promoted to army group commander with creation of the U.S. 2nd Army.
## British and French Advances in the West (pp. 290–291)
- On 27 September, Haig launched a massive assault east of Cambrai.
  - French and three British armies advanced across difficult terrain and German resistance.
  - Germans conducted orderly withdrawals while destroying infrastructure.
- Progress was steady but hard-fought; the British took Aulnoye and reached Maubeuge by early November.
- Morale collapsed in German ranks—desertion rose, soldiers protested continued fighting, and units jeered at comrades still marching to the front.
## Additional Allied Offensives (p. 291)
- On 28 September, British, French, and Belgian forces launched another attack in Flanders toward the coast.
  - Little German resistance remained; rain and terrain were greater obstacles than enemy fire.
- French forces also attacked the Laon bulge, pinning Germans in place to support flanking movements.
## The Final Collapse (p. 292)
- The German front held tactically but was disintegrating internally.
  - Political leadership sought to shift blame for the impending defeat.
  - The army, though battered, continued retreating in order and resisting until the end.
- On 11 November 1918, Canadian patrols entered Mons—the war ended where Britain had first fought in 1914.
# 22. The Collapse of the Central Powers
## The Fall of Bulgaria (pp. 293–295)
- The Allied offensive from Salonika under General Franchet d’Esperey began in mid-September 1918.
  - Troops included French, British, Italians, Serbs, Greeks, and Czechoslovaks.
  - Bulgaria’s army collapsed quickly; Allied forces advanced nearly 100 miles, reaching Serbia and pushing toward Sofia.
- Bulgaria had already sought peace; by 29 September an armistice was signed at Salonika.
  - Bulgaria became the first Central Power to surrender.
  - Terms included demobilisation, evacuation of occupied territory, and free Allied movement through Bulgaria.
## Collapse of the Ottoman Empire (pp. 295–296)
- British General Allenby launched a breakthrough at Megiddo on 19 September.
  - Rapid cavalry and air advances encircled Turkish forces, causing 75,000 casualties.
  - Damascus was taken on 2 October, Aleppo shortly after; French marines landed at Beirut.
- Sultan Mohammed VI dismissed the Young Turk leadership and sought peace via President Wilson.
  - General Townshend was sent to arrange terms; the armistice was signed at Mudros on 30 October.
  - Terms included Allied control of Turkish territory, ports, and demobilisation—effectively ending the Ottoman Empire.
## Dissolution of Austria-Hungary (pp. 296–298)
- Austria’s offensive on the Piave in June 1918 failed disastrously.
  - Italian counterattack began on 24 October at Vittorio Veneto, resulting in a complete rout.
  - Italian forces advanced rapidly; Trieste and Fiume were taken by early November.
- The empire fragmented as national groups declared independence:
  - Czechoslovakia on 21 October; Yugoslavia on 29 October; Hungarians and Austrians themselves seceded soon after.
  - Emperor Charles proposed a federal state too late and abdicated on 12 November.
- Armistice signed on 3 November, but by then Austria-Hungary no longer existed as a functioning state.
## German Domestic Collapse and Peace Overtures (pp. 298–300)
- Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg was replaced by a series of weak figures, culminating in Prince Max of Baden in October 1918.
- Growing unrest: strikes in January, Reichstag peace resolution in July 1917 led by Matthias Erzberger.
  - The military retained control but failed to address public dissatisfaction or hardship.
- After Bulgaria’s collapse, Ludendorff demanded peace negotiations; Max of Baden appealed to President Wilson on 4 October, accepting the Fourteen Points as a basis.
## Wilson’s Conditions and German Political Crisis (pp. 301–304)
- Wilson’s replies hardened over time:
  - He questioned whether Max spoke for the German people or the Kaiser.
  - He demanded a halt to submarine warfare and internal political reform.
- Ludendorff briefly reversed course, calling to continue the war, but was overruled and resigned on 27 October.
- On 28 October, a last-ditch order to the German fleet to fight triggered a naval mutiny, which sparked revolution across Germany.
  - Soldiers and workers formed councils; demands included the Kaiser’s abdication and democratic reforms.
## German Revolution and the Armistice (pp. 304–307)
- By 8 November, major German cities were in open revolt; Bavaria declared a republic.
- Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November and fled to the Netherlands.
  - General Wilhelm Groener convinced Hindenburg and the Kaiser of the futility of resistance.
- A German delegation led by Erzberger met Marshal Foch in Compiègne.
  - Harsh terms included Allied occupation west of the Rhine, surrender of matériel and ships, and withdrawal from all fronts.
- [[WWI Armistice|Armistice]] was signed in Foch’s railway car early on 11 November 1918; ceasefire took effect at 11:00 a.m.
# 23. Peacemaking
## Exclusion of the Vanquished and the Spirit of the Conference (pp. 308–309)
- Unlike 1815, the 1919 peace conference excluded the defeated powers entirely.
  - The war had taken on the tone of a moral crusade, making reconciliation politically and emotionally impossible.
  - The enemy was demonised—Hun atrocities vs. Allied blockade starvation—leaving no room for compromise.
- Woodrow Wilson arrived as a revered figure, believing deeply in democracy and his own vision of peace.
  - His messianic attitude clashed with other leaders’ practical concerns and nationalist agendas.
## Economic Costs and Casualties of the War (pp. 309–310)
- The Carnegie Endowment estimated the war’s cost at $338 billion (in 1920 dollars), though the figure was speculative.
  - Human lives were given monetary value: $4,720 per American, $2,900 per Frenchman, $2,020 per Russian.
- Casualties:
  - Allies mobilised 42 million men; 22 million became casualties (52%)
  - France suffered 73% losses; Russia 76%; British Empire 36%; U.S. only 8%
  - Central Powers: 23 million mobilised; 15 million casualties—Austria-Hungary lost 90% of its men
## The Paris Peace Conference and Power Structure (pp. 310–311)
- Conference opened 18 January 1919 with 27 Allied nations; real power was quickly consolidated.
- A Supreme Council of Ten was formed, soon reduced to the “Big Four”: Wilson, Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and Orlando.
- Wilson dominated early sessions with the Fourteen Points, but his influence faded due to political troubles at home.
## Contrasting National Aims (pp. 311–312)
- Lloyd George wanted a quick economic recovery and generous peace, but had promised a punitive one at home.
- Clemenceau aimed to cripple Germany permanently to ensure France’s future security.
- Orlando simply wanted all territory promised to Italy in the Treaty of London—and more.
## Franco-American Rift and Rhineland Dispute (pp. 312–313)
- France sought to separate the Rhineland and create a buffer republic; Britain and the U.S. offered a mutual defence treaty instead.
  - The U.S. Senate later refused to ratify the treaty, leaving France without either concession.
## Russia and the Bolsheviks (p. 313)
- Bolsheviks were excluded from the main conference; an island summit was proposed but failed as White generals refused to attend.
- Allied intervention in Russia was minor and ineffective; Lenin’s regime survived despite predictions.
## Wilson’s Focus on the League of Nations (pp. 313–314)
- Wilson prioritised the League of Nations above all else.
  - Faced opposition from Britain on freedom of the seas and from all powers on reparations and colonies.
- Jan Smuts proposed the “mandate system” to resolve the colonial deadlock:
  - Former German colonies would be governed by Allies on behalf of the League.
## Drafting the Covenant and U.S. Political Collapse (p. 314)
- The League covenant was eventually approved without a general staff or army, as France had wanted.
- Wilson returned home to face a hostile Republican Senate and was forced to water down the covenant.
  - His weakened position emboldened the other powers to push their own agendas.
## Reparations and Financial Gridlock (pp. 314–315)
- Reparations became the most contentious issue—what should be counted, and how much Germany should pay?
  - No final sum was agreed upon in the treaty; Germany accepted responsibility and obligation to pay later-defined amounts.
- The issue remained unresolved for years, exacerbated by Allied war debts and global financial instability.
## German Frontiers and Border Disputes (pp. 315–316)
- Germany was diminished in territory to strengthen border states:
  - Poland was restored with access to the sea (cutting off East Prussia); Danzig made a free city.
  - The Sudetenland was given to Czechoslovakia; the Rhineland was demilitarised.
- These arrangements became rallying points for German revisionism in the 1930s.
## Italy’s Disappointment and Irredentism (p. 316)
- Italy demanded full execution of the Treaty of London and additional gains like Fiume.
  - When denied, the Italians walked out, later returning only to sign the treaty.
  - Italy became a frequent critic of the Versailles system, demanding further revision.
## The Paris Treaties and Germany’s Protest (p. 317)
- Five treaties were signed: Versailles (Germany), St. Germain (Austria), Trianon (Hungary), Neuilly (Bulgaria), Sèvres (Ottoman Empire).
  - The [[Treaty of Versailles]] was the most significant; Germany refused to sign until threatened with invasion.
  - Article 231—the “war guilt clause”—was particularly hated.
- The U.S. Senate rejected the treaty; the U.S. made a separate peace in 1921.
## Ottoman Settlement and Aftermath (pp. 317–318)
- Treaty of Sèvres dismantled the Ottoman Empire; mandates and territorial awards were distributed.
  - Harsh terms provoked Turkish resistance led by Mustafa Kemal; replaced by Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.
## Final Assessment (p. 318)
- The treaties were deeply flawed but not uniquely so; created under immense pressure and trauma.
- Despite their limitations, postwar diplomacy has not consistently improved upon their outcomes.
  - As the author notes, even nursery children know Humpty Dumpty can't be put back together again.
