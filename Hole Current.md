As [[Electron|electrons]] move within an intrinsic [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]], and escape their valence shells and become conduction electrons, they leave behind gaps or **holes** in the atoms they leave.

If this happens in multiple atoms in succession, as electrons move to the right, say, the holes can be said to "move" to the left, as they are created and subsequently filled by the next electron that is moving to the right. This gives the appearance of a second type of [[current]] within semiconductors, namely, a **hole current**.
