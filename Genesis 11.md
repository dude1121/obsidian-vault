[[Genesis 10|Previous]] [[Genesis 12|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 9*. [[Tower of Babel]].
- *6*. God recognizes the power of united humans and seeks to destroy this unity.
- *7*. God confuses the languages.
	- This is the Biblical answer to the variety of human languages around the world.
- *9*. They sought to build a tower into heaven, going against God's direction to fill the earth, not stay in one place.

# Thoughts
The tower of Babel is often used as a way to say we shouldn't try to make a name for ourselves, but it seems the real issue God had with it was the violation of command to fill the earth. The story of [[Nimrod]] echoes the story of [[Gilgamesh]] founding the city of [[Uruk]]. [[Genesis 10|Gen 10.10]] says Nimrod built Erech. So, likely, Nimrod _was_ Gilgamesh.

We also are yet to have a way to convert AA to BCE. There is a lot of overlap and I thought God had [[Genesis 6|limited the lifespan of humans]] before the flood. Yet many born after the floor including up to [[Abraham]] live more than 120 years.
