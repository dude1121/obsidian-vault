On July 23, 1914, [[Austria-Hungary]] sends the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] an ultimatum following the [[Assassination of Franz Ferdinand]]. The ultimatum makes several demands including:
1. Suppress any publication inciting hatred or contempt of the Monarchy and any works promoting actions against its territorial integrity.
2. Dissolve the "Narodna Odbrana" society and confiscate its propaganda tools, similarly addressing other organizations in Serbia involved in anti-monarchy activities, ensuring these groups cannot reconstitute themselves under a different name or form.
3. Remove from Serbian public education any content - whether in teaching staff or instructional materials - liable to incite propaganda against Austria-Hungary.
4. Dismiss from military and civil service all officers and officials guilty of anti-monarchy propaganda, with the names and offences to be communicated by the Imperial and Royal Governments.
5. Permit Austro-Hungarian representatives to collaborate in Serbia in the suppression of the subversive movement targeting the Monarchy's territorial integrity.
6. Initiate judicial proceedings against those implication in the June 28 conspiracy within Serbian territory, with Austro-Hungarian delegates participating in the investigations.
7. Immediately arrest Commandant Vojislav Tankosić and Milan Ciganović, a Serbian state employee implicated by the Sarajevo investigation.
8. Prevent Serbian authorities from aiding the illegal trafficking of arms and explosives across the border and dismiss and severely punish officials at the Šabac and Loznica border posts who assisted the assassins of Sarajevo.
9. Provide explanations regarding hostile remarks made by Serbian officials, both domestically and abroad, who, despite their official status, expressed hostility toward the Monarchy in interviews following the June 28 attack.
10. Notify the Imperial and Royal Government without delay of the execution of these measures.
This ultimatum was to be responded to by Saturday, July 25 at 5:00 p.m.

This ultimatum was a major part of the [[July Crisis]] that served as a prelude to [[World War I|WWI]].
