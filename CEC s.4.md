> Provided that when in metal enclosures all conductors of feeder circuits employing a common neutral are contained within the same enclosure, a common neutral shall be permitted to be employed for
> 	a) two or three sets of 3-wire, single-phase feeders; or
> 	b) two sets of 4-wire, three-phase feeders

That is, *all conductors must be in the same metal enclosures*. For [[Light Fixture|lighting]] circuits, shared neutrals are considered to be [[Current|current]]-carrying.
