A **solar power plant** is a power generating station that converts [[Light|light]] into [[Electrical Energy|electrical energy]].  As of 2023, solar made up less than $1\%$ of Ontario's power consumption. Estimates state that the available solar power on earth is about $1\pu{ kW/m^2}$.
# Operation
A solar power plant is an array of [[Solar Panel|solar panels]] also known as a photovoltaic (PV) array.

Sunlight in the form of [[Photon|photons]]  strikes the face of the [[Solar Cell|PV cells]]. These photons induce a voltage in the cell. The *charge controller* helps match the voltage generated by the panel with the battery voltage as well as change the condition of the PV panels (see [[Solar Cell#I-V Curve|I-V Curve]]) to maximize power generation. This might include physically rotating the panel to have it align better with the sun but the charge controller can also adjust the working conditions of the semiconductor.

The [[Battery|batteries]] store the power generated until it is required by the grid. This is a two-way connection between the batteries and the [[Invertor|inverters]] so that it can be stored and released easily. The inverters convert the generated [[DC Electricity|dc voltage]] into [[AC Electricity|ac]] which is then sent to a [[Transformer|transformer]] which steps up the voltage and sends it out to the grid.
# Pros and Cons
Solar power is both free and entirely green. This makes it a very attractive option for electricity generation. However, solar is very expensive to build at about $\$10 /\pu{ W}$ and, since PV cells are semiconductors, these cells have a lifespan and they will become less effective as their life goes on. This means that these cells need to be replaced every $20-30$ years.
