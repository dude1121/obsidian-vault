**Motion** is when an object changes its [[Position|position]] with respect to a reference point in a given [[Time|time]]. We say the motion of an object is completely known if the object's position in space is known at all times. Motion can be translational or *linear*, or it can be rotational, or *angular*.

There are many models of motion that are useful to help us solve specific problems. They include: [[Motion under Constant Velocity|motion under constant velocity]], [[Motion under Constant Acceleration|motion under constant acceleration]], [[Projectile Motion|projectile motion]], [[Uniform Circular Motion|uniform]] and [[Nonuniform Circular Motion|nonuniform circular motion]]. For angular motion, there is a similar model, that of the [[Rigid object under constant angular acceleration|rigid object under constant angular acceleration]].
