**Water** is an inorganic [[Compound|compound]] with chemical formula $\ce{H_{2}O}$. 

# Chemical Properties

The bonds of a water [[Molecule|molecule]] are bent, with an $\ce{H-O-H}$ angle of approximately $105\degree$. The [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] and [[Oxygen|oxygen]] atoms are bound by [[Covalent Bond|covalent bonds]], but the electrons are not evenly shared between the two atom types. Oxygen is able to better attract electrons than hydrogen is, which has the effect of inducing a slight [[Voltage|potential difference]] across the molecule. The oxygen atom gains a partial negative [[Charge|charge]] $\ce{2\delta-}$ and the hydrogen atoms gain a partial positive charge $\ce{\delta+}$. Because of this, water is a [[Polar Molecule|polar molecule]]. This polarity allows water to dissolve [[Compound|compounds]].

When a compound dissolves in water, the "positive" end of the water molecules are attracted to the anions in the compound, and the "negative" end of the water molecules are attracted to the cations. This process is known as [[Hydration|hydration]]. When a [[Ionic Compound|salt's]] ions are hydrated, it "falls apart" in the water, pulled apart by the water molecules.

Note though that when this happens, the salt dissolves into its individual cations and anions. For example, when ammonium nitrate $\ce{NH_{4}NO_{3}}$ dissolves in water, the solutions contains $\ce{NH_{4}+}$ and $\ce{NO_{3}-}$ ions moving independently.

\ce{NH_{4}NO_{3}(s)->[H_{2}O(l)] NH_{4}+ (aq) + NO_{3}-(aq)}

The ability of a compound to dissolve in water is called its [[Solubility|solubility]].  Some compounds are very soluble like [[Sodium Chloride|sodium chloride]] whereas others are less soluble, like silver chloride. 

Nonionic compounds can also be soluble. [[Ethanol]] $\ce{C_{2}H_{5}OH}$, for example, is very soluble. This is because it contains a [[Hydroxide|hydroxide]], a polar $\ce{O-H}$ bond, that makes ethanol very compatible with water.
