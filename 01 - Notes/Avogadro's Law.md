**Avogadro's law** is a law that states that the [[Volume|volume]] of a [[Gas|gas]] is proportional to the number of particles present in that gas.
$$
V\propto n
$$
$$
V=an
$$
where $a$ is a proportionality constant and $n$ is the number of particles in [[Mole|moles]] $[\pu{ mol}]$. This relationship holds for gases at low pressures. This law forms part of the [[Ideal Gas Law|ideal gas law]].
