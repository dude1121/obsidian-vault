The **Voltage Divider Rule** allows us to quickly find the voltage across any component given it is in series with some other component or form of [[Impedance|impedance]] or [[Resistance|resistance]]. For any component, $\mathbf{Z_1}$, so long as the total impedance of the components ($\mathbf{Z_T}$) is known and the total voltage drop across the series components ($\mathbf{V_{ZT}}$) is known, the voltage across it can be found by,
$$
	\mathbf{V_{Z1}}=\left(\frac{\mathbf{Z_1}}{\mathbf{Z_T}}\right)\mathbf{V_{ZT}}
$$
