The **Lorentz Force Law** is a law that governs the [[Force|force]] acting on a [[Charge|charged]] [[Particle|particle]] moving in the presence of both an [[Electric Field|electric]] and [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]]. It states,
$$
\vec{\mathbf{F}}=q\vec{\mathbf{E}}+q\vec{\mathbf{v}}\times\vec{\mathbf{B}}
$$
This total force is called the *Lorentz Force*. It is a sum of the electric force ($\vec{\mathbf{F_e}}=q\vec{\mathbf{E}}$) and the magnetic force ($\vec{\mathbf{F_B}}=q\vec{\mathbf{v}}\times\vec{\mathbf{B}}$). 

If the assumption is made that all vectors are perpendicular to one another, this can be simplified into,
$$
F_{B}=B\ell I
$$
where $I$ is the current through the conductor in a magnetic field, and $\ell$ is the *active length* of the conductor, that is, the length of the conductor that is within the magnetic field.
