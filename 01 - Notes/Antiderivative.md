An **antiderivative** is a function for which another given function is its [[Derivative|derivative]]. For example, if $f(x)=x^3+4x$, then its antiderivative is $F(x)=\frac{1}{4}x^4+2x^2$. A function's antiderivative is not the same as the [[Integral|integral]] of a function, since it does not consider the [[Integration Constant|integration constant]].
