Intrinsic [[Semiconductor|semiconductors]] have difficulty producing free [[Electron|electrons]] since their [[band gap]] is larger than normal [[Conductor|conductors]]. We can change this by introducing other types of atoms into a semiconductor, causing it to produce free electrons, or increase the amount of "holes". This is called *n-type* and *p-type* doping, respectively.

## n-Type Doping

If we add pentavalent (an element that has 5 valence electrons) elements to pure [[Silicon|silicon]], it will create [[Covalent Bond|covalent bonds]] with 4 silicon [[Atom|atoms]]. The remaining valence electron will then become a free electron. Doping a material in this way produces many free electrons, giving the material a slightly negative [[Charge|charge]].

## p-Type Doping

Adding a trivalent (an atom with only 3 valence electrons) atom to pure silicon will result in the element making covalent bonds with 4 silicon atoms, much like the pentavalent element, but there will be one electron missing. This has the effect of creating [[Hole Current|holes]] in the doped material. Since there are many electrons missing, this has the overall effect of making the material slightly positively charged.
