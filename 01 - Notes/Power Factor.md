**Power factor** $F_{p}$ is a unitless value. It represents the percentage of a load that is [[Real Power|real]]. 
$$
F_{p}=\cos \theta
$$
In a purely [[Resistance|resistive]] circuit, $F_{p}=1$, and in a purely [[Reactance|reactive]] circuit, $F_{p}=0$. If the current leads the voltage, we say that the circuit has a *leading* power factor, else we say the circuit has a *lagging* power factor.
