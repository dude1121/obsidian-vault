The **Coulomb** is the [[Units of Measurement|unit of measurement]] of [[Charge|charge]]. It is defined as,
$$
1\text{C}=1\text{ A}\cdot\text{s}
$$
The Coulomb can also be defined as the amount of charge contained in a group of $6.241509\times10^{18}$ [[Electron|electrons]]. 
$$
1\text{C}=6.241509\times10^{18}e^-
$$
Rearranging,
$$
1e^-=1.602177\times10^{-19}\text{C}
$$
This is known as the [[Elementary Charge|elementary charge]].
