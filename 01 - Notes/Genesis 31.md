[[Genesis 30|Previous]] [[Genesis 32|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. [[Laban|Laban's]] sons are complaining that [[Jacob]] stole from them.
- *3*. God tells Jacob to go back to the land of [[Isaac]] and [[Abraham]].
	- This differs from [[Genesis 30|30.25]] where [[Rachel]] is the one who wants to return home.
- *7*. Laban cheated Jacob's wages ten times, according to Jacob.
- *10 - 13*. Instead of the sheep being born speckled because of the poplar rods, this time God causes them to be born that way because he notices Laban's mistreatment of Jacob.
	- This is an interesting note, that just like Rachel and the [[Genesis 30|mandrakes]], God later intervenes to bless Rachel and Jacob's uses of superstition. It seems that God is confirming the superstition, or at least acting in accordance with it.
- *17 - 18*. Jacob and his family leave to go to [[Canaan]].
- *19*. Rachel takes Laban's "gods" - likely ancestor figurines or totems - while he is out shearing sheep.
- *20*. Jacob yet again deceives Laban by leaving without telling Laban.
- *23*. Laban catches up with Jacob in [[Gilead]].
- *24*. God tells Laban to not speak to Jacob.
- *26*. Obviously, Laban then goes ahead and speaks to Jacob.
- *27 - 30*. Laban says that, had Jacob not left covertly, Laban would have showered him with gifts, but now he wishes to harm him and it is only because God told him not to that he won't. He then asks why his gods were stolen.
- *32*. Jacob denies stealing the gods, unaware of what Rachel did.
- *34*. Rachel sits on the idols while Laban checks her tent. 
- *35*. After checking the tent Laban goes to check Rachel's saddle but she claims she can not get up because she is menstruating.
	- This is an interesting addition as well because at this time the idea of uncleanness due to menstruation was not yet codified.
- *41*. Jacob had been in Laban's house for 20 years: 14 of which he slaved for [[Leah]] and Rachel, and the last 6 he worked on Laban's flocks. In those twenty years, Laban changed Jacob's wages ten times (see v.7).
	- This is an interesting timeline. According to [[Genesis 29]], Leah did not start having children until Jacob had already married Rachel. This means that all twelve children were born within 6 years of one another. Leah had at least ***seven*** children in that time. Assuming she carried all seven for a full nine month term, that means 63 out of 72 (87.5%!!) months she was pregnant. That poor woman.
- *44 - 54*. Laban and Jacob make a covenant with one another to resolve this disagreement.
	- *47*. Laban apparently speaks [[Aramaic]], since he names the stone heap upon which the covenant is made "Jegar-sahadutha", Aramaic for "heap of witness." Jacob calls it "Galeed", [[Hebrew]] for the same thing.
		- Interesting to note that Galeed and Gilead have the same root in Hebrew. 
	- *49*. Laban calls the pillar that they construct [[Mizpah]], meaning 'watchpost.'
	- *52*. Laban makes Gilead stand as the border for Jacob and Laban. Laban stays to the north, and Jacob to the south.
	- *53*. Jacob swears by the 'fear' of his father Isaac. The meaning of this Hebrew phrase is uncertain.
		- This same word is used in verse 42. This is different from the traditional "[[Fear of God|fear of God]]." Some scholars have proposed it might mean something akin to 'refuge' of Isaac, but there is no true consensus.
- *55*. Laban is finally able to kiss and bless his daughters and grandchildren.
# Thoughts
Jacob and Laban have this sort of mutual trickster relationship with one another. They both deceive one another multiple times over the course of Jacob's 20 year stay.

If Laban is supposed to be faithful, since he makes covenants in God's name, why does he care about these "gods" that Rachel took? Why does he have them in the first place? Even if he truly isn't faithful, why did Rachel take them? The note in the [[New Oxford Annotated Bible|NOAB]] and in the *Insight* book both mention that may have been equivalent as title deeds, and Rachel taking them represented her taking the right to the land. But shouldn't God's people be 'separate' from 'worldly' traditions? Why would they hold on to pagan imagery simply since it was the custom?

Speaking of the idols, the [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]] does not even attempt to translate the Hebrew 'teraphim' (תרפים) and instead transliterates it. Why? The [[King James Version|KJV]] and [[Septuagint|LXX]] both translate it as "images", the [[JPS Tanakh|Tanakh]] says "idols", and the [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]] and [[English Standard Version|ESV]] say "gods". I guess the word is hard to translate, sure, but it is notable that the NWT doesn't even try.
