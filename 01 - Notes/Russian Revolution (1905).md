The **1905 Russian Revolution**, sometimes called the **First Russian Revolution**, was a [[Revolution|revolution]] that began with bloody Sunday on January 9, 1905[^1] and led to the creation of the [[Duma]] and [[Russian Constitution (1906)]]. 
# Background
Leading up to 1905, the Russian peasantry had become increasingly upset with the autocratic regime under Tsar [[Nicholas II]]. The promises made by [[Alexander II|Alexander the Liberator]] had been long forgotten as most peasants were now stuck with incredible debts that the peasants couldn't hope to repay. They faced further repression by landlords.

In addition to peasant grievances, Russia had become engaged in a [[Russo-Japanese War|war they were badly losing]] against the Japanese and the people were beginning to hear reports of soldiers dying against an enemy they thought they would beat easily. Urban unemployment had reached very high levels at this time as well.

In the later months of 1904, the liberal Liberation movement organized a banquet campaign, through which many of the social elite expressed a desire for constitutional reform. The government also faced pressure from terrorist groups, student demonstrations, and workers' strikes.

In December 1904 workers at the Putilov Ironworks were fired due to their membership with a group known as the Assembly.[^2] This firing resulted in nearly the entire Putilov Ironworks going on strike, followed by sympathetic strikes across the city. By January 8, Saint Petersburg was without electricity and newspapers due to some 150,000 workers striking. 
# Bloody Sunday
On January 6, 1905, a group of workers, led by Priest Georgy Gapon (also known as Father Gapon), wrote and signed a petition making the plight of the workers clear and calling for improved working conditions, fair wages, and an 8-hour working day. The petition also called for an end to the [[Russo-Japanese War|war]] and [[Universal Suffrage|universal suffrage]]. 

Three days later on January 9, Gapon led a group of workers to the [[Winter Palace]] to deliver the petition to the Tsar. Gapon had previously informed the minister of the Interior that he was going to come to the palace on the 9th and he expected the Tsar to be present. When hearing of this, Nicholas left the palace on January 8 for [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. 

On the morning of January 9, crowds gathered across the city and marched toward the Winter Palace. The exact size of these crowds is disputed: police records say there were 3,000 demonstrators whereas the organizers themselves claim there were 50,000. 

As the groups made their way through the city, there were instances of shootings by the imperial guard. Unlike most popular depictions of the day, there was no one encounter outside the winter palace, but rather there were a series of separate incidents at bridges or entry points to the centre of Saint Petersburg where the imperial guard fired on unarmed demonstrators.

The total casualties, like the number of demonstrators, is a subject of debate. The Tsar's official records state 96 dead and 333 injured, whereas anti-government sources claim more than 4,000 died. Modern historians place the total somewhere between 800 and 1,100.
# Reactions to Bloody Sunday and Revolution
Across Russia demonstrations sprung up in response to January 9th. In June the crew of the battleship [[Potemkin]] mutinied and in October a rail worker strike became a general strike in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. At first, Nicholas had announced in February that he would establish an elected assembly that would advise the government, but this did not satisfy the strikers.

Throughout the empire, even in Poland, Finland, the Baltics, and Georgia, revolution had spread. In some areas though, anti-revolutionary [[Black Hundreds]] attacked socialist groups and staged [[Pogrom|pogroms]] against Jews. 

On October 13 the Saint Petersburg Soviet was formed. It initially directed the general strikes that were occurring across the empire but as other parties joined it became more like a revolutionary government. Similar soviets sprung up in Moscow, Odessa, and other major cities.

This forced Nicholas into action. On October 17 he issued the [[October Manifesto]] which promised a constitution and the establishment of the Duma. He elected Minister of Finance [[Sergei Witte]] as Russia's first Prime Minister.
# Response to October Manifesto
The socialists and some liberals felt these concessions were not enough and were not satisfied by the manifesto.[^3] However, other moderate and right-wing groups declared October 17 a victory and returned to work. This weakened the revolutionaries, especially the St. Petersburg Soviet. The leader of the soviet along with other members, including [[Leon Trotsky]], were arrested on December 3. The general strikes across the empire were put down one way or another with some fighting in Moscow and especially in Poland, the Baltics, and Georgia.

By the beginning of 1906 the government had nearly entirely regained control of the Trans-Siberian railroad (and by extension, the imperial army, since they had been stuck in Manchuria since the railroad strikes began). This essentially ended the revolution.

[^2]: Full name was the Assembly of the Russian Factory and Mill Workers of the City of St. Petersburg. It had the goal of defending workers' rights in the factories of Saint Petersburg.

[^3]: This was short-lived however. While the liberals were not satisfied by the October Manifesto, their efforts were no longer focused on revolution but on political organization and the formation of two important political parties: the [[Octobrist Party|Octobrists]], those who supported the October manifesto; and the Constitutional Democrats, also known as the [[Cadet Party|Cadets]].
