**Frequency** is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of [[time]]. It is usually denoted with the symbol $f$, and is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Hertz]] $[\text{Hz}]$. It shares an inverse relationship with the [[Period|period]].

# Telecommunications

In telecommunications, frequency is divided into various designations as follows:

| Frequency                         | Designation             | Abbreviation |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| $30-300\pu{\! Hz }$               | Extremely Low Frequency | ELF          |
| $300-3000\pu{ \! Hz}$             | Voice Frequency         | VF           |
| $3-30\pu{ \! Hz }$                | Very Low Frequency      | VLF          |
| $30 - 300\pu{ \! kHz }$           | Low Frequency           | LF           |
| $300\pu{ \! kHz }-3\pu{ \! MHz }$ | Medium Frequency        | MF           |
| $3-30\pu{ \! MHz }$               | High Frequency          | HF           |
| $30 - 300\pu{ \! MHz }$           | Very High Frequency     | VHF          |
| $300\pu{ \! MHz }-3\pu{ \! GHz }$ | Ultra High Frequency    | UHF          |
| $3-30\pu{ \! GHz }$               | Super High Frequency    | SHF          |
| $30 - 300\pu{ \! GHz }$           | Extra High Frequency    | EHF          |
