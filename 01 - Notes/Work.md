**Work** is a [[Scalar|scalar]] quantity defined as [[Energy|energy]] transferred to an object due to an applied [[Force|force]] that results in some [[Displacement|displacement]]. A force is said to do *positive* work if the force and the displacement of the object are in the same direction. Work is measured in [[Joule|joules]] $[\pu{ J}]$. 
$$
W=F\Delta d\cos \theta
$$
$\theta$ in the above definition is the angle between the applied force and the resultant displacement. It follows then that if the force and displacement are $90\degree$ from one another, no work is done (since $\cos 90\degree=0$). Instead of finding the angle between the two vectors, we can instead take the [[Dot Product|dot product]] of the applied force and the object's [[Position|position]] along the path the object travels.
$$
W=\int_{\mathbf{r}_{i}}^{\mathbf{r}_f} \sum\mathbf{\vec{F}}\cdot d\mathbf{\vec{r}}
$$
where $d\mathbf{\vec{r}}$ is a small change in the position vector. This formula is especially useful if the force is time-varying. Work can be related to [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]] by the [[Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem|work-kinetic energy theorem]]. 

It is important to note, however, that this relationship only holds if the net force $\sum F$ is [[Conservative Force|conservative]], since conservative forces do not vary according to the path taken. [[Nonconservative Force|Nonconservative forces]] do, so a more intricate path would have more work done than a shorter, more concise path.
