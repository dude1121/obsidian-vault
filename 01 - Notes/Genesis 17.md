[[Genesis 16|Previous]] [[Genesis 18|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. Abram is 99 years old. This means that the [[Abrahamic Covenant|covenant]] is enacted in 2047 after Adam (see timeline [[Genesis 11|here]]).
- *5*. Abram becomes [[Abraham]].
	- The extra syllable here, 'ham', comes from the Hebrew 'hamon,' meaning 'multitude.' Abraham, therefore, means 'ancestor of a multitude.'
- *7 - 8*. God establishes his covenant with Abraham.
- *10*. The stipulation for the covenant is that every male must be circumcised.
- *14*. Failure to be circumcised is seen as breaking this covenant.
- *15*. Sarai becomes [[Sarah]].
- *16*. Sarah will give rise to nations, plural.
- *20*. [[Ishmael]] again is prophesied to have a large offspring.
	- He will be the father of 12 princes and a great nation.
- *23 - 27*. All men in Abraham's house are circumcised.
# Thoughts
Once again, the link between Ishmael and [[Islam]] intrigues me. Especially the part about him being father to 12 princes and a nation. These princes are identified in [[Genesis 25]]. 

This chapter is also the origin of circumcision in the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] and in some parts of [[Christianity]].
