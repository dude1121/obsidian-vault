A **chemical reaction** is a change in the organization of the [[Atom|atoms]] in one or more substances.

# Chemical Equations

We can write the process of a chemical reaction as an equation. For example, methane $\ce{CH_{4}}$ in natural gas, when combined with oxygen $\ce{O_{2}}$ and burned, produces [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] $\ce{CO_{2}}$ and [[Water|water]] $\ce{H_{2}O}$. This can be represented with a chemical equation. On the left side of the equation are the *reactants* and the *products* are on the right side, where both sides are separated by a right-facing arrow.
$$
\ce{CH_{4} + O_{2}-> CO_{2} + H_{2}O}
$$
Its important to remember that in a chemical reaction, all atoms present in the reactants must be accounted for among the products. There must be the same number of each type of atom on each side of the equation. Making sure this rule is obeyed is called *balancing a chemical equation*.

To make sure our above equation is balanced, let's count the atoms on each side.

| Reactant              | Count | Product               | Count |
| --------------------- | ----- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     | Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     |
| Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     | Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 2     |
| Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 2     | Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 3     |

Clearly our equation is not balanced. To fix this, we need to change the coefficients of each substance so that the atom count lines up. If we alter the equation like so,
$$
\ce{CH_{4} + 2O_{2}-> CO_{2} + 2H_{2}O}
$$
and then recount our atoms,

| Reactant              | Count | Product               | Count |
| --------------------- | ----- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     | Carbon $\ce{C}$       | 1     |
| Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     | Hydrogen $\ce{ {H} }$ | 4     |
| Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 4     | Oxygen $\ce{O}$       | 4     |
we now see that everything lines up, and the equation is balanced. Note that the formulas for each compound were not altered when the equation was balanced, only the coefficients. This balancing must occur due to the [[Law of Conservation of Mass]].

# Types of Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions can broadly be defined into three distinct categories: *precipitation reactions*, *acid-base reactions*, *oxidation-reduction reactions*. 

## Precipitation Reactions

When two [[Solution|solutions]] are mixed they can sometimes result a [[Solid|solid]] forming that separates from the solution. This solid that forms is called a [[Precipitate|precipitate]] and the reaction as a whole is called a *precipitation reaction*. 

## Acid-Base Reactions

Acid-base reactions are also known as *neutralization reactions*.
