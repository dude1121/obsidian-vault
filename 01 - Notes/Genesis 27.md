[[Genesis 26|Previous]] [[Genesis 28|Next]]
# Summary
- *1*. [[Isaac]] is old and blind.
- *2 - 3*. Isaac asks [[Esau]] to go out and hunt some game for him. 
- *7 - 10*. [[Rebekah]] prepares [[Jacob]] to trick Isaac and obtain a blessing from him. She tells Jacob to go and select two kids from the flock so that she may prepare them.
- *14 - 17*. Rebekah prepares the mean and grabs some of Esau's animal skins for Jacob to wear to disguise him, since Jacob was concerned that since he is not as hairy as Esau, Isaac will know it is him.
- *18 - 23*. Isaac is doubtful that it is in fact Esau who has brought him the meal, but he gives his blessing anyways.
- *24 - 25*. Isaac confirms that it is Esau he is speaking to, and Jacob confirms this. Yet again, we see a patriarch blatantly lying.

- *28 - 29*. Isaac blesses Jacob. In particular, this blessing includes him becoming lord over his brothers.
- *33*. Isaac realizes he has been tricked.
- *36*. Esau gives some pretty on-the-nose symbolism based on the meaning of Jacob's name.
- *38*. Esau is rightly angry that Jacob stole his blessing.

>$^{\small39}$Then his father Isaac answered him:
>'See, away from the fatness of the earth shall your home be,
>and away from the dew of heaven on high.
>$^{\small 40}$By your sword you shall live,
>and you shall serve your brother;
>but when you break loose,
>you shall break his yoke from your neck.'

>- NRSV

- *39 - 40*. Esau receives a similar prophecy from his father but it is not a blessing like Jacob's. Instead, Isaac prophesies a period of servitude to Jacob for Esau's descendants, although there is the hope that after some time they will revolt and no longer be subjugated. 
- *41 - 42*. Due to being tricked, Esau is very angry and he swears that he will kill Jacob after his father dies.
- *43 - 45*. Rebekah sends Jacob away to [[Laban]] so that Esau does not kill him.
- *46*. Rebekah last makes a plea to Isaac to ensure Jacob does not marry a [[Hittites|Hittite]] woman.
# Thoughts
These patriarchs and their lies. Seems very hypocritical. How does God go on to bless Jacob despite his lies?

Future note here. This kind of builds on my thoughts from [[Genesis 21]]. Jacob obviously continues this pattern of succumbing to his 'wicked' human nature. But this story along with the birthright story in [[Genesis 25]] seem to develop a theme for Jacob's character which is explored later: Jacob fights for things he feels he deserves. He haggles for the birthright, he deceives Isaac to win the blessing, later he will [[Genesis 32|wrestle an angel]] all night in order to obtain a blessing. He even [[Genesis 29|slaves for 14 years]] just to have the woman that he loves. Jacob, later known as Israel, quite blatantly seems to represent the spirit of the nation of [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] itself, constantly fighting those around them obtain blessings.
