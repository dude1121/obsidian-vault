**Distance** (typically denoted as $d$) is the [[Scalar|scalar]] counterpart to [[Displacement|displacement]]. It is the magnitude of a given change in [[Position|position]] and is measured in [[Metre|metres]] $[\pu{m}]$. Taking the [[Derivative|derivative]] of distance with respect to [[Time|time]] will yield [[Speed|speed]], the scalar counterpart of [[Velocity|velocity]]. 
$$
v=\frac{d}{dt}d
$$
This therefore means that distance is the [[Integral|integral]] of speed.
$$
d=\int v\ dt
$$
