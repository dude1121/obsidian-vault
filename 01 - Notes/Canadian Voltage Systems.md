In [[Canada]], there are two main types of **voltage systems**: line [[Voltage|voltage]] (or sometimes, $1\phi$) "Edison system", and three phase ($3\phi$).  The section of the [[Canadian Electrical Code|CEC]] that pertains to circuit loading is [[CEC s.8|section 8]].
# Edison system
The [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] system consists of two lines and a neutral. The line-neutral voltage is typically $120\pu{ V}$ and the line-line voltage is $240\pu{ V}$. This means that the two lines are $180\degree$ apart from one another.

# Three phase
A three phase system consists of either a [[Wye|wye]] or [[Delta (Power System)|delta]] configured system. Common typical voltages include $120/208\pu{ V}$, $347/600\pu{ V}$, and $277/480\pu{ V}$ (the lower voltages are only if the system is wye configured).
