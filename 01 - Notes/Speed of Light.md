The **speed of light** or, more accurately, the **speed of light in a vacuum**, is the [[Speed|speed]] at which [[Light|light]] and other forms of [[Electromagnetic Radiation|electromagnetic radiation]] propagate through [[Vacuum|free space]]. It is typically denoted with the symbol $c$ and it has a value of
$$
c=299\ 792\ 458\pu{\!  m/s }
$$
Specifically it is defined as,
$$
c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \varepsilon_{0}\mu_{0} }}
$$
where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the [[Permittivity|permittivity]] of free space and $\mu_{0}$ is the [[Permeability|permeability]] of free space, both of which, like $c$ itself, are physical [[Constant|constants]].
