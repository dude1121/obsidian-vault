A **solenoid** is a device formed by a wound coil of wire whose length is substantially greater than its diameter. The purpose of a solenoid is to generate a controlled [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]] when a [[Current|current]] is passed through it. The [[Magnetic Flux|magnetic flux density]] of a solenoid is given by,
$$
B=\mu_{0}\frac{NI}{\ell}
$$
where $B$ is the flux density in [[Tesla|teslas]] $[\pu{ T}]$, $\mu_{0}$ is the [[Permeability|permeability]] of free space, $N$ is the number of turns in the solenoid, $I$ is the current through the solenoid in [[Amperes|amps]] $[\pu{ A}]$, and $\ell$ is the length of the solenoid in [[Metre|metres]] $[\pu{ m}]$. This is an application of [[Ampère's Circuital Law|Ampère's circuital law]].
