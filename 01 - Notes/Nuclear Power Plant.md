A **nuclear power plant** is a thermal power station that uses heat from a [[Nuclear Reaction|nuclear reaction]] to [[Generator|generate]] electricity. In Ontario, nuclear power makes up about $53\%$ of the total consumed electricity.
# Operating principle
A nuclear power plant consists of five main systems: *fuel handling*, *power generation*, *reactor*, *safety systems*, and *steam generation*.

The overall power flow consists of [[Fuel Rod|nuclear fuel rods]] that are submerged in some coolant, typically [[Water|water]] but it could be gas or even liquid metal. The fuel rods make up the *core*, and this core is bombarded with [[Neutron|neutrons]], causing a [[Nuclear Fission|fission]] reaction. This fission reaction heats up the coolant which is then sent to the boiler. Within the boiler, the heated coolant heats up the water within the boiler into steam, which is then sent to a [[Steam Turbine|turbine]]. The turbine begins to rotate and therefore rotates the generator, causing it to generate an output [[Voltage|voltage]] which is then [[Transformer|stepped up]] and sent out via [[Transmission Line|transmission lines]]. 

To control the fission reaction, the pressure vessel must have a *moderator*, typically [[Heavy Water|heavy water]]. This moderator helps control the fission reaction and keeps it from going out of control.
