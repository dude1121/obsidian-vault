A **crystalline solid** is a [[Solid|solid]] that has a highly regular structure in its [[Molecule|molecules]]. Crystalline solids can form different types of structures and these structures give the solid its physical properties including [[Hardness|hardness]], [[Melting Point|melting point]], etc. We can use [[X-ray Diffraction|X-ray diffraction]] to determine the structure of a given solid.

All crystalline solids are made up of a [[Lattice|lattice]] structure made up of smaller [[Unit Cell|unit cells]]. An example is shown below of three different types of unit cells that make up three larger lattices. From left to right these are the lattices of [[Polonium|polonium]], [[Uranium|uranium]], and [[Gold|gold]].

Crystalline solids can be split broadly into three types depending on what they have at their lattice points.
# Ionic solids
Ionic solids have [[Ion|ions]] at their lattice points. They are characterized as having high [[Melting Point|melting points]], being brittle, and hard. Examples include [[Sodium Chloride|sodium chloride]] $\ce{NaCl}$ (salt) or [[Magnesium Oxide|magnesium oxide]] $\ce{MgO}$. In these solids there are no chemical bonds between the ions. Instead, they consist of ions held together by [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] forces.
# Molecular solids
Molecular solids consist of [[Molecule|molecules]] at their lattice points, held together by [[Intermolecular Forces#Dipole-Dipole|dipole-dipole]] interactions, [[Intermolecular Forces#London dispersion|london dispersion]] forces, [[Intermolecular Forces#Hydrogen bonding|hydrogen bonds]], or any combination of these.
# Atomic solids
