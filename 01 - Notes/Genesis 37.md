[[Genesis 36|Previous]] [[Genesis 38|Next]]
# Summary
- *2*. [[Joseph]] brings a bad report to [[Jacob]] about [[Dan (Person)|Dan]], [[Naphtali (Person)|Naphtali]], [[Gad (Person)|Gad]], and [[Asher (Person)|Asher]].
	- Joseph is 17 years old here. If we accept that this happens after Isaac's death, this is anywhere from 2228 - 2041 AA (assuming Joseph is, at minimum, 4 years old when Isaac dies, which places Joseph's approximate birth year from 2211 - 2024 AA).
- *3*. Jacob plays favourites and loves Joseph the most ("because he was the son of his old age"). He has a 'long robe with sleeves' made for Joseph.
	- The [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]] calls this a "long robe with sleeves." The traditional rendering, as seen in the [[King James Version|KJV]] or [[Septuagint|LXX]] is "a coat of many colours." The original Hebrew meaning here is unclear. This coat could possibly be made form the speckled, spotted, and colour sheep that Jacob took from [[Laban]].
- *4*. Joseph's brothers are jealous of him because he was Jacob's favourite. They even 'hate him' because of it. 
- *5*. Joseph has a dream, and his brothers hate him even more once he tells it.
- *7*. Joseph's dream involves him and his brothers binding sheaves, when suddenly Joseph's sheaf stands upright and the sheaves of his brothers bow down to Joseph's.
- *8*. Joseph's brothers hate him because he presumes that he will rule over his brothers.
- *9 - 11*. Joseph has another dream. This time, the sun, moon, and eleven stars all bow down to him. When he tells it to Jacob, Jacob rebukes him.
	- Jacob interprets this dream as meaning that he and [[Rachel]] would bow down to him as well. The inclusion of Rachel in this statement is interesting considering she died in [[Genesis 35]]. Possibly in earlier versions of the text Rachel died after this?
- *12 - 17*. Joseph is sent by Jacob to meet his brothers in [[Shechem]] where they are pasturing the flock. Joseph departs [[Hebron]] for Shechem, where he is directed by someone there to Dothan where his brothers actually are.
	- Shechem has made quite the rebound given that they were all massacred in [[Genesis 34]].
- *18*. Joseph's brothers conspire together to kill him.
- *21*. [[Reuben (Person)|Reuben]] steps in and says they shouldn't kill Joseph, just throw him into a cistern.
- *22*. This was not a selfless suggestion though, as Reuben planned to return later and 'rescue' him so that he might gain favour with Jacob.
- *23 - 24*. The brothers strip Joseph of his coat and throw him into a pit.
- *26 - 27*. [[Judah (Person)|Judah]] suggests that they sell Joseph to the passing Ishmaelites, since Dothan was on a trading route. 
- *28*. The identity is confusing here. Even though Joseph's brothers *just* said that they wanted to sell Joseph, this verse identifies the Midianites as the ones who pull Joseph out of the well and sell him to the Ishmaelites. Other verses (see [[Genesis 45|Gen. 45.4-5]]) state that it was Joseph's brothers who sold him.
- *31*. The eleven brothers slaughter a goat and dip Joseph's coat into its blood.
- *33*. They bring this coat to Jacob who recognizes it as Joseph's and immediately assumes a wild animal killed him.
- *35*. This is the first mention of [[Sheol]] (שאול‎) or, as the [[Septuagint]] translates it as, [[Hades]]. 
	- Sheol is the Hebrew afterlife where everyone went when they died. Ancient Hebrews made no distinction between [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]. This view actually partially validates the JW interpretation.
- *36*. The Midianites sell Joseph to [[Potiphar]] despite having already sold him to the Ishmaelites in verse 28.
# Thoughts
Only big difference here is the translation of Sheol in verse 35. The [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]] and [[JPS Tanakh]] both keep it as Sheol, [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]] and [[King James Version|KJV]] say 'grave', and the [[Septuagint]] as mentioned says 'Hades'.
