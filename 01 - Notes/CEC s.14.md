## 1)
>The rating or setting of overcurrent devices shall not exceed the allowable ampacity of the conductors that they protect, except
>	a) where a [[Fuse|fuse]] or [[Circuit Breaker|circuit breaker]] having a rating or setting of the same value as the ampacity of the [[Conductor|conductor]] is not available, and the maximum calculated or known load is in accordance with the Rules of [[CEC s.8|Section 8]], the ratings or settings given in [[CEC t.13|Table 13]] shall be permitted to be used within the maximum value of 800 A;
>	b) in the case of equipment wire, flexible cord in sizes Nos. 16, 18, and 20 AWG copper, and tinsel cord, which are considered protected by 15 A overcurrent devices; or
>	c) as provided for by other Rules of this Code.

That is, *if the calculated ampacity of the circuit does not have a 1:1 corresponding circuit breaker, we can use [[CEC t.13|Table 13]] to determine an appropriate [[Overcurrent Device|overcurrent device]].*
