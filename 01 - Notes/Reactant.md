In chemistry, a **reactant** is a substance that takes part in and undergoes a change during a [[Chemical Reaction|chemical reaction]]. Reactants are often changed to produce [[Product (Chemistry)|products]]. Sometimes reactants and *reagents* are used interchangeably, but technically speaking a reactant refers only to a substance *consumed* in a chemical reaction. 

Reactants are always on the left side of a chemical equation, but not all items on the left side are reactants. [[Solvent|Solvents]] and [[Catalyst|catalysts]], for example, are not consumed during reactions and are typically not considered reactants.
