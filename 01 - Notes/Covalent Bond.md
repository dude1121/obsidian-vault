A **covalent bond** occurs when two [[Atom|atoms]] are [[Chemical Bond|bonded]] by sharing [[Electron|electrons]]. A covalent bond results in a [[Molecule|molecule]]. Covalent bonds form from atoms that have a similar negative [[Charge|charge]]. The goal of this type of bond is to fill the atom's [[Valence Shell|valence shell]]. 

Take two [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] atoms for example. Normally, these two atoms have only one valence electron each, but the first electron orbital can support $2$ electrons. To become more stable, then, two hydrogen atoms may form a bond wherein they share their two electrons between the both of them, simultaneously filling both their valence shells. It is for this reason that elements like hydrogen, [[Nitrogen|nitrogen]], and [[Oxygen|oxygen]] (among others) are found in their molecular form $\ce{H_{2}}$, $\ce{N_{2}}$, and $\ce{O_{2}}$, respectively. These bonds might be written as $\ce{H-H}$ to indicate that the two atoms are sharing electrons. 

Since covalent bonds are prevalent between atoms with similar [[Electronegativity|electronegativity]] $\chi$, covalent bonds are much more common between [[Non-Metals|non-metals]] than they are among [[Metals|metals]].
