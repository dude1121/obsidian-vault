[[Genesis 38|Previous]] [[Genesis 40|Next]]
# Summary
After our brief interlude with Judah, the narrative now flips back to [[Joseph]].
- *1*. In contrast with [[Genesis 37]], we are now told the *Ishmaelites* sold Joseph to [[Potiphar]], not the Midianites.
- *2 - 3*. Joseph becomes successful in service to Potiphar because "the LORD was with Joseph."
- *4*. Potiphar appoints Joseph in charge of all his household and all his possessions. 
- *5*. This is the fifth time that we read of God either being with Joseph or blessing Joseph. 
- *6 - 7*. Potiphar's wife asks Joseph to "lie" with her, since Joseph is apparently very "handsome and good-looking."
- *8 - 9*. Joseph refuses this offer. He reasons that Potiphar has given him everything in his house except his own wife, so it would be ungrateful and greedy to sleep with her. He calls it a "sin against God."
	- I wonder if this is a possible parallel to [[Adam]] and [[Eve]]. God gave them everything except told them not to eat of the [[Tree of Knowledge|tree of knowledge]]. Yet where Adam and Eve were unfaithful, Joseph remains resolute.
- *11 - 12*. Potiphar's wife tries again to make advances on Joseph. She grabs his garment and asks him. While she is still holding his garment, Joseph flees and leaves the garment in her hands.
- *13 - 15*. She brings attention to members of her household (who in 39.11 apparently aren't even in the house) and presents Joseph's garment as evidence against him.
	- This parallels Genesis 37.33 where the brothers bring Joseph's coat to Jacob. Once again, his clothing is used as misleading evidence against him.
- *16 - 18*. Potiphar's wife says that Joseph was actually the one who made advances on her and tried to rape her. She eventually says these things to Potiphar himself.
- *19 - 20*. Upon hearing these claims, Potiphar has Joseph put in prison.
- *21*. Once again, "the LORD was with Joseph" and he "finds favour" with the chief jailer.
- *22*. Just like in Potiphar's house, Joseph is essentially 2nd in command in the prison, something that [[Genesis 41|will be repeated a third time with Pharaoh]]. 
# Thoughts
There is a minor discrepancy in this story regarding the identity of who sold Joseph to Potiphar but it is not a big deal. Joseph throughout this story shadows Abraham, Isaac, and his father Jacob. The idea of the journey that all the others experienced, the servitude Jacob experienced, and the saying of God being with Joseph echoes the promise God gave to Abraham.
