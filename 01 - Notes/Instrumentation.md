**Instrumentation** is a discipline that deals with measurement devices and instruments used for indicating, measuring, and recording physical quantities. These devices used for these purposes are called *sensors* and *transducers*. Instrumentation is a key part of [[Control Systems|control systems]].
# Sensors & Transducers
A **sensor** is an instrument that detects physical variables (e.g. temperature, pressure, etc.). A **transducer** is a device that converts the data a sensor detects into an electrical signal of some sort. In modern days, sensors and transducers are often combined into one package.

These devices allow us to provide feedback within a control system to control the output.

The elements of a process control system are shown above. Instrumentation deals with the red block, sensors. While the actual control of the system is done via the controller, the quality of process control is only as good as its sensors.
