# 28-010 Special terminology
**Service** - Relates to the nature of the mechanical load. 
**Continuous duty** - "any application of a motor where the motor can operate continuously with load under  any normal or abnormal condition of use"
**Non-continuous duty** - start and stop types of load. e.g. elevators, conveyors, presses
**Service factor** - a multiplier that, when applied to the rated horsepower of an ac motor, to the rated armature current of a dc motor, or to the rated output of a [[Generator|generator]], indicates a permissible loading that may be carries continuously at rated voltage and frequency. For example, typical values for the service factor range from $1.0-1.2$, so if the service factor was $1.1$ then a $10\pu{ hp}$ could run at $11\pu{ hp}$.
# 28-106 Insulated conductors - individual motors
## 1)
> The insulated conductors of a branch circuit supplying a motor for use on continuous duty service shall have an ampacity not less than $125\%$ of the full load current rating of the motor.

## 2)
> The insulated conductors of a branch circuit supplying a motor for use on non-continuous duty service shall have an ampacity not less than the current value obtained by multiplying the full load current rating of the motor by the applicable percentage given in [[CEC t.27|table 27]] for the duty involved, or varying duty service where a deviation has been allowed in accordance with [[CEC s.28#2-030 Deviation or postponement|Rule 2-030]] by a percentage less than that specified in table 27.

# 28-200 Branch circuit overcurrent protection
## 1)
> Each ungrounded conductor of a motor branch circuit shall be protected by an overcurrent device in accordance with Subrules 2) to 5).

## 2)
> The overcurrent device required by subrule 1)  shall be
> 	a) a non-time-delay [[Fuse|fuse]];
> 	b) a time-delay fuse;
> 	c) an inverse-time [[Circuit Breaker|circuit breaker]];
> 	d) an instantaneous-trip (magnetic only) circuit interrupter applied in accordance with [[CEC s.28#28-210 Instantaneous-trip circuit breakers|Rule 28-210]];  or
> 	e) a self-protected combination motor controller selected in accordance with [[CEC s.28#28-500 Control Required|Rule 28-500]].

## 3)
> The rating of the overcurrent device required by Subrule 1) shall
> 	a) not exceed the values given in [[CEC t.29|table 29]] using the rated full load current of the motor, except that an overcurrent device having a minimum rating or setting of $15\pu{ A}$ shall be permitted even though
