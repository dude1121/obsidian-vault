### Summary
##### Copper Conductors
The maximum ampacity depends on installation method:
- **Free air, widely spaced cables** (≥100% spacing): use **Table 1**
- **Raceways or 2–3 conductor cables**: use **Table 2**
- **4+ conductors in raceways/cables**: use **Table 2** + **Table 5C** correction
- **Underground, ≥1/0 AWG, to 5 kV**: use **Tables D8A–D11B** or **IEEE 835**
- **Underground, ≥1/0 AWG, not in above tables**: use **IEEE 835**
- **Underground, <1/0 AWG**: use **Table 2** or **IEEE 835**
- **Shielded cables 5–46 kV (2 AWG–1000 kcmil)**: use **Tables D17A–D17N** or **IEEE 835**
##### Aluminum Conductors
Follow the same logic as copper, but use:
- **Table 3** (free air)
- **Table 4** (raceways/cables)
- **Table 4 + Table 5C** (4+ conductors)
- **Same underground tables or IEEE 835**
##### Special Conditions
- **Neutral Conductor**:
  - Not counted in ampacity if it carries only unbalanced current in 3+ conductor circuits
  - Counted if it carries significant current (e.g. line-to-neutral loads in 3-phase, 4-wire)
- **Bonding Conductors**: Never counted in ampacity
##### Correction Factors (Ambient/Spacing)
Apply only to power/lighting conductors unless exempted:
- **Table 5A**: Ambient temperature >30 °C
- **Table 5B**: Free air with spacing <25% cable diameter (≤4 conductors)
- **Table 5C**: 
  - 4+ conductors
  - Cables in trays or raceways (ventilated/non-ventilated)
- **Table 5D**: Free air or ventilated tray spacing 25–100%
##### Spacing Scenarios in Free Air
- **≥25% and ≤100% spacing**: use Tables 1/3 × **Table 5D**
- **<25% spacing (≤4 cables)**: use Tables 1/3 × **Table 5B**
- **>4 cables, <25% spacing**: use Tables 2/4 × **Table 5C**
- **≤600 mm length with <25% spacing**: no correction required
##### Multi-Conductor Cables
- If run in contact >600 mm: apply **Table 5C**
- Different temp ratings in raceway: use **lowest rated**
- Adding cables to raceway: apply rules to **all conductors**
##### Underground to Above-Ground Transition
- Use **lower ampacity**, unless:
  - Transition segment is ≤3 m or ≤10% of circuit length: **higher ampacity is allowed**
##### Load Factor Adjustments
- If **load factor <1.00**, and proven, ampacity may be **increased** proportionally (no diversity allowed beyond this)
##### Special Cases
- **Nickel conductors**: use **IEEE 835**
- **Bare/covered conductors in free air**: use **Table 66**
- **Cable trays (ventilated, ladder type)**:
  - \>100% spacing: use **Tables 1/3 or 2/4 × Table 5C**
  - 25–100% spacing: multiply values by **Table 5D**
  - <25% or non-ventilated: use **Table 2/4 × Table 5C**
- **Cablebus** in >30 °C: apply **Table 5A** to nameplate ampacity

> 1) Where sheath currents in single-conductor cables having continuous sheaths of lead, aluminum, stainless steel, or copper are likely to cause the insulation of the conductors to be subjected to temperatures in excess of the insulation ratings, the cables shall be 
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>a) derated to 70% of the current-carrying rating that would otherwise apply;
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>b) derated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and in compliance with [[CEC s.2#2-030 Deviation or postponement|Rule 2-030]]; or
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>c) installed in a manner that prevents the flow of sheath currents.
> 2) Circulating currents in single-conductor armoured cable shall be treated in the same manner as sheath currents in Subrule 1).
> 3) Single-conductor cables and single insulated conductors carrying more than $200\ \mathrm{A}$ shall not enter ferrous metal boxes through individual openings.
> 4) Where single-conductor cables and single insulated conductors carrying more than $200\ \mathrm{A}$ enter ferrous metal boxes, precautions shall be taken to prevent overheating of the wall of the box by induction.
> 5) Precautions to be taken to prevent overheating of the metal shall include the use of non-ferrous or non-metallic box connectors or cable glands, locknuts, bushings, and ground bushings.
> 6) All cables and insulated conductors making up a circuit shall enter the box through one common non-ferrous or insulating plate having a minimum thickness of $6.0\ \mathrm{mm}$ unless a deviation is allowed in accordance with [[CEC s.2#2-030 Deviation or postponement|Rule 2-030]].
> 7) Where single-conductor mineral-insulated cables are used, all current-carrying conductors shall be grouped together to minimize induced voltage on the sheath.
# 4-020 Common neutral conductor
> Provided that when in metal enclosures all conductors of feeder circuits employing a common neutral are contained within the same enclosure, a common neutral shall be permitted to be employed for
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>a) two or three sets of 3-wire, single-phase feeders; or
> 	<span>&emsp;</span>b) two sets of 4-wire, three-phase feeders

That is, *all conductors must be in the same metal enclosures*. For [[Light Fixture|lighting]] circuits, shared neutrals are considered to be [[Current|current]]-carrying.
