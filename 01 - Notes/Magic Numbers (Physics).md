In nuclear physics **magic numbers** refer to a series of numbers that, when a [[Nucleus|nucleus]] contains [[Proton|protons]] or [[Neutron|neutrons]] in quantities that match one of these numbers, the nucleus is especially stable and has much higher [[Nuclear binding energy|binding energy]] than nuclei with non-magic amounts of protons or neutrons. The magic numbers are,
$$
Z\text{ or }N=2,\ 8,\ 20,\ 28,\ 50,\ 82,\ 126
$$
These numbers were determined empirically but they stem from [[Nuclear Shell Theory|nuclear shell theory]]. These numbers are very similar to the stable numbers of [[Electron|electrons]] found in the [[Noble Gas|noble gases]]. 
# Doubly magic
If a nucleus contains a magic amount of protons *and* a magic amount of neutrons, we call that nucleus *doubly magic*. Doubly magic nuclei are especially stable and have among the highest binding energies of any [[Isotope|isotope]]. Examples of doubly magic isotopes include [[Helium#Helium-4|helium-4]], [[Oxygen#Oxygen-16|oxygen-16]], [[Calcium#Calcium-40|calcium-40]], [[Calcium#Calcium-48|calcium-48]], and [[Lead#Lead-20|lead-208]].
