**Voltage gain** is a ratio between the voltage output of an [[Amplifier|amplifier]] circuit and the input voltage. It is typically denoted as $A_{v}$. Since it is a ratio, voltage gain is [[Units of Measurement|unitless]] but might sometimes be given the units $[\pu{ V}/\pu{ V}]$.
$$
A_{v}=\frac{V_{o}}{V_{i}}
$$
Typically if $A_{v}<1$, it is called the circuits *attenuation* and not gain, since the output voltage is not greater than the output voltage.
