The **project charter** is a document that formally authorizes a [[Project|project]] and documents the initial requirements that satisfy the stakeholders' needs and expectations. *The approval of the project charter formally initiates the project*. The project charter must contain:
- project description
- project purpose
- project [[Business Case|business case]]
- project [[Deliverable|deliverables]]
- project [[Milestone|milestones]]
- project [[Project Resources|resources]]
- project [[Budget|budget]]
- internal and external [[Stakeholder|stakeholders]]
- project risks
- project [[Constraint|constraints]]
- team member roles and responsibilities

There is no official project without an approved project charter.
