[[Genesis 27|Previous]] [[Genesis 29|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 5*. In this account, instead of [[Rebekah]] sending [[Jacob]] away to protect him from [[Esau]], [[Isaac]] sends Jacob to [[Laban]] of his own volition.
	- Future note. I don't think this is a fair critique as it seems this verse is simply a continuation from the end of the last chapter where Rebekah pleaded with Isaac to not let him marry a [[Hittites|Hittite]] woman.
- *9*. Esau takes Mahalath (daughter of [[Ishmael]]) as an additional wife.
- *10*. Jacob leaves Beer-sheba and heads towards Haran.
- *11 - 17*. While on the way to Haran, Jacob dreams of a ladder (or possibly, stairway) from earth to [[Heaven|heaven]], and [[Angel|angels]] are ascending and descending the ladder. 
- *14*. Like his father and [[Abraham|grandfather]], Jacob receives a promise of a large offspring and that his offspring will live in this land.
