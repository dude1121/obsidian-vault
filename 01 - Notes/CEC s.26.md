# Transformers
## 26-240 Transformers — General 
> 1) In this Subsection,
> 	a) "[[Transformer]]" shall mean a single-phase transformer, a polyphase transformer, or a bank of two or three single-phase transformers connected to operate as a polyphase transformer; and
> 	b) "unit substation" shall mean an integrated unit consisting of one or more transformers, disconnecting means, overcurrent devices, and other associated equipment, each contained in a suitable enclosure designed and constructed to restrict access to live parts. 
> 2) Transformers shall be constructed so that all live parts are enclosed unless they are installed to be inaccessible to unauthorized persons.

## 26-242 Outdoor transformer and unit substation installations
> 1) Except as permitted by Subrule 2), where transformers or unit substations, including their conductors, cables, and control and protective equipment, are installed outdoors, they shall
> 	a) be installed in accordance with [[CEC s.26#26-012 Dielectric liquid-filled equipment - Outdoors|Rule 26-012]] if they are dielectric liquid-filled;

> 		i) $1\ \pu{ m}$ for three-phase transformers; and
> 		ii) $0.6\ \pu{ m}$ for single-phase transformers.

I.e., if there are exposed live parts of the transformer then the enclosure requires a fence (unless the transformer is more than $3.6\ \pu{ m}$ above ground) and an adequate warning sign indicating the highest voltage present.

> A disconnecting means shall be installed in the primary circuit of each power and distribution transformer.
## 26-250 Overcurrent protection for power and distribution transformer circuits rated over $750\ \pu{ V}$

> 	a) rated at not more than $150\%$ of the rated primary current of the transformer in the case of fuses; and
> 	b) rated or set at not more than $300\%$ of the rated primary current of the transformer in the case of breakers.
> 2) Where $150\%$ of the rated primary current of the transformer does not correspond to a standard rating of a fuse, the next higher standard rating shall be permitted. 
> 3) An individual overcurrent device shall not be required where the feeder or branch circuit overcurrent device provides the protection specified in this Rule.

![[CEC t.50]] 
## 26-252 Overcurrent protection for power and distribution transformer circuits rated $750\ \pu{ V}$ or less, other than dry-type transformers
> 1) Except as permitted in Subrule 2) to 6), each ungrounded conductor of the transformer feeder or branch circuit supplying the transformer shall be provided with overcurrent protection rated or set at not more than $150\%$ of the rated primary current of the transformer.
> 2) Where the rated primary current of a transformer is
> 	a) $9\ \pu{ A}$ or more, and $150\%$ of this current does not correspond to a standard rating of a fuse or non-adjustable circuit breaker, the next higher standard rating shall be permitted; or
> 	b) less than $9\ \pu{ A}$, an overcurrent device rated or set at not more than $167\%$ of the rated primary current shall be permitted, except that where the rated primary current is less than $2\ \pu{ A}$, an overcurrent device rated or set at not more than $300\%$ of the rated primary current shall be permitted. 
> 3) An individual overcurrent device shall not be required where the feeder or branch circuit overcurrent device provides the protection specified in this Rule.
> 4) A transformer having an overcurrent device on the secondary side rated or set at not more than $125\%$ of the rated secondary current of the transformer shall not be required to have an individual overcurrent device on the primary side, provided that the primary feeder overcurrent device is rated or set at not more than $300\%$ of the rated primary current of the transformer. 
> 5) Notwithstanding Subrule 4), where the secondary current of a transformer is
> 	a) $9\ \pu{ A}$ or more, and $125\%$ of this current does not correspond to a standard rating of a fuse or non-adjustable circuit breaker, the next higher standard rating shall be permitted; or
> 	b) less than $9\ \pu{ A}$, an overcurrent device rated or set at not more than $167\%$ of the rated secondary current shall be permitted.
> 6) A transformer equipped with coordinated thermal overload protection by the manufacturer and arranged to interrupt the primary current shall not be required to have an individual overcurrent device on the primary side if the primary feeder overcurrent device is rated or set at a value
> 	a) not more than $6$ times the rated current of the transformer for a transformer having not more than $7.5\%$ [[Impedance|impedance]]; or
> 	b) not more than $4$ times the rated current of the transformer for a transformer having more than $7.5\%$ but not more than $10\%$ impedance.

I.e., if the primary current is $100\ \pu{ A}$, each conductor needs to be rated for no more than $150\ \pu{ A}$. 

For example, if the primary current is $90\ \pu{ A}$, then $150\%$ of the primary current is $135\ \pu{ A}$, which does not correspond to a standard breaker size (see [[CEC t.13|table 13]]). This rule allows us to go up to a $150\ \pu{ A}$ breaker.

[^1]: The intent of these Subrules is to provide both series (also called low-level) and parallel (also called high-level) arc-fault protection downstream from the panelboard through the entire branch circuit wiring, including cord sets and power supply cords connected to the outlets.
	
	Considering that the outlet branch-circuit-type arc-fault circuit interrupter does not provide upstream parallel arc-fault protection, [[CEC s.26#26-658 Arc-fault protection of branch circuits for dwelling units|Rule 26-658]] b) ii) requires mechanical protection for the portion of the branch circuit between the branch circuit overcurrent device and the first outlet. The mechanical protection minimizes the risk of direct contact with and damage to the cable that could cause ignition due to an arc and spread of the flame should ignition occur.

[^2]: The intent of this Subrule can be met by installing
		a) a combination-type arc-fault circuit interrupter located at the origin of the branch circuit; or
		b) an outlet branch-circuit-type arc-fault circuit interrupter at the first added receptacle or upstream from the added receptacle.

[^3]: The normal enclosure for this equipment is not to be considered as the barrier referred to in this Subrule.

[^4]: It should be noted that, in accordance with CSA C22.2 No. 29, panelboards are tested to operate normally at ambient temperatures up to $40\ \degree\mathrm{C}$.

[^5]: Where in dwelling units, the branch circuit breakers are equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters of the Class A type, panelboards containing these circuit breakers should be provided with a self-adhesive label indicating the test procedure for the ground fault circuit interrupter and a chart for recording the tests.

[^6]: Flood hazard zones are designated by local floodplain management regulations or local bylaws.

[^7]: Where the *National Building Code of Canada* mandates the installation of smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms in a "house with a secondary suite" (i.e., an additional dwelling unit created by subdivision of a dwelling unit), these alarms are required to be interconnected so that activation of any one alarm will cause all respective alarms to sound. The *National Building Code of Canada* recognizes wired and wireless interconnection. This Subrule does not apply to wireless interconnection.
	
	The intent of the warning labels is to provide adequate warning that shutting off the branch circuit in the original dwelling unit will disconnect the respective smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms in the additional dwelling unit, and that the panelboard in the additional dwelling unit does not disconnect the respective smoke alarms or carbon monoxide alarms located within that dwelling unit.

[^8]: The term "sink" is intended to include kitchen sinks, bar sinks, laundry sinks, utility room sinks, wash basins, etc., that are connected to a plumbing drain pipe. it is not intended to include portable wash basins.
	
	It is not intended that the $1.5\ \mathrm{m}$ dimension be extended through a wall opening that is fitted with a door. Where a room combines a wash basin or shower/bathing facilities with an area serving another purpose, such as an ensuite bathroom in a bedroom, requirements for receptacles located in such rooms or areas should be considered similar to the requirements for receptacles located in bathrooms and washrooms.
	
	It is also intended that no receptacle be located directly behind any sink unless the distance between the wall and the inside edge of the sink exceeds $450\ \mathrm{mm}$, such as in the case of a diagonal corner sink. ![[cec-figure-b26-1.png]]
