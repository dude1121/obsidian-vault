In mathematics, a **constant** is either a [[Number|number]] or a [[Function|function]]. As an object, a constant could be defined as:

>[!quote] Constant
>A fixed and well-defined number or the [[Symbol|symbol]] denoting it. E.g. 0, 1, 42, [[Pi|pi]] $\pi$, [[Euler's Number|Euler's number]] $e$, the [[Gravitational Constant|gravitational constant]] $G$, etc.


However, any number that does not vary could be considered a constant. For example, in defining a [[Linear Equations|linear equation]]
$$
mx+b
$$
the terms $m$ and $b$ could be considered constants, since they do not change, whereas $x$ is a [[Variable|variable]] that does change. Alternatively, $m$ may be referred to as a "coefficient", and $b$ would be the "constant". 

[[Integration]] also makes use of constants for definite integrals.
