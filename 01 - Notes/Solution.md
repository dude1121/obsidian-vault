A **solution** is a homogenous mixture of liquid and solute [[Molecule|molecules]]. 

Solutions can be characterized depending on its [[Conductance|conductivity]]. If the solution conducts electricity well then the solution contains strong [[Electrolytes|electrolytes]]. If the solution conducts electricity but does so poorly, it is said to have weak electrolytes. If the solution does not allow any current to flow, it contains nonelectrolytes.
