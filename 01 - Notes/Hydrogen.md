**Hydrogen** is a chemical [[Element (Chemistry)|element]] with symbol $\ce{H}$ and [[Atomic Number|atomic number]] $1$. It is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe, making up about $75\%$ of all matter. In [[Standard Temperature and Pressure|standard conditions]] hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules with formula $\ce{H_{2}}$.

# Isotopes
The most common isotope of hydrogen is $\ce{^1H}$ which consists of one [[Proton|proton]] and one [[Electron|electron]]. There are two other observed isotopes, $\ce{^2H}$ (called [[Deuterium|deuterium]]) and $\ce{^3H}$ (called [[Tritium|tritium]]). All three of these isotopes have been observed naturally. The fact that these three isotopes have special names is unique to hydrogen, and special symbols may be given to these isotopes ($\ce{D}$ for deuterium and $\ce{T}$ for tritium).

## Hydrogen-1
$\ce{^1H}$ is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of $99.9855\%$. It is a stable isotope. Since the [[Nucleus|nucleus]] of this isotope only has a single proton it is sometimes called *protium*. $\ce{^1H}$ is the only stable isotope with no neutrons (see [[Helium#Helium-1|diproton]]). 
## Hydrogen-2
$\ce{^2H}$, also known as deuterium, is the second stable isotope of hydrogen. It has an abundance of $0.0145\%$. It is thought that almost all deuterium was synthesized in the [[Big Bang]]. Deuterium is a very important isotope for nuclear technology, especially [[Nuclear Fusion Reactor|nuclear fusion experiments]]. It is also used as a [[Moderator (Nuclear Reactor)|moderator]] in [[Nuclear Reactor|fission reactors]] in the form of [[Heavy Water|heavy water]] $\ce{D_{2}O}$. 
## Hydrogen-3
$\ce{^3H}$, also known as tritium, is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, decaying into [[Helium#Helium-3|helium-3]] via [[Beta Minus Decay|beta minus decay]] with a [[Half-Life|half-life]] of $12.32$ years. Tritium is radioactive enough to be used in luminous paint on watches, for example. Tritium is released in [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear weapons testing]] as well as in [[Nuclear Reactor|fission reactors]] as a byproduct. Tritium also has uses in nuclear fusion.
