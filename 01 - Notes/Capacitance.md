**Capacitance** is a measure of a [[Capacitor|capacitor]] to store [[Charge|charge]] on its plates. Put another way, capacitance is a capacitor's *storage capacity*. The higher the capacitance, the greater amount of charge is stored on a capacitor's plates. Capacitance is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in *[[Farads]]*, named after English scientist, Michael Faraday. Capacitance is defined as,
$$
	C=\frac{Q}{V}
$$
where $C$ is the capacitance in Farads $[\text{F}]$, $Q$ is the charge in Coulombs $[\text{C}]$, and $V$ is [[Voltage|voltage]] in [[Volts]] $[\text{V}]$. We can also define capacitance purely in terms of the construction of the capacitor by,
$$
	C=\varepsilon\frac{A}{d}
$$
where $\varepsilon$ is the [[Permittivity|permittivity]] of the [[Dielectric|dielectric]], $A$ is the cross sectional area of the plates in $[\text{m}^2]$, and $d$ is the distance between the plates in $[\text{m}]$.
