[[Genesis 20|Previous]] [[Genesis 22|Next]]
# Summary
- *3*. [[Isaac]] is born. 
	- [[Abraham]] is 100 years old, therefore Isaac is born 2048 years after Adam (see timeline [[Genesis 11|here]]).
- *6*. [[Sarah]] says God has brought laughter to her, again referencing the theme of laughter regarding Isaac.
- *10*. Sarah again has issue with [[Hagar]] and brings the issue to Abraham.
- *13*. Once again, God promises to make [[Ishmael]] into a nation.
- *14*. It is interesting that Ishmael is referred to as a child, being able to be put on Hagar's shoulder. Yet, in [[Genesis 17|Gen 17.25]], when Abraham is 99 years old and circumcises Ishmael who is 13 at the time. At this point in time in Genesis 21, Ishmael should be at least 14, hardly a young boy.
- *15 - 19*. Hagar and Ishmael run out of water and she is ready to let her and her son die. Yet, in verse 17 an [[Angel|angel]] visits her and directs her to a well.
- *21*. Ishmael marries an Egyptian woman.
- *22 - 24*. [[Abimelech]] asks Abraham to not "deal falsely" with him.
- *25 - 34*. Abimelech and Abraham make a covenant at the well at [[Beer-sheba]].
- *33*. "Everlasting God," Heb. 'El Olam'
# Thoughts
We see a parallel of Hagar being kicked out by Sarah as she was in [[Genesis 16|chapter 16]]. Yet again, Ishmael is foretold to become a large nation.

From a more removed perspective, it seems that this story of Abraham and his son Isaac is better understood as men who did not know how to be the perfect servant trying their best despite their shortcomings. After all, God now believes that "every inclination of the human heart is evil" ([[Genesis 8|Genesis 8.21]]), so much of the shortcomings of the patriarchs can been seen as them succumbing to their human nature.

Abraham and Isaac are deceitful constantly, Sarah ridicules an angel, but yet they remain loyal. Abraham's covenant with Abimelech symbolizes his promise to him (but really to God) to no longer be deceitful and remain honest. This promise to remain honest and loyal is tested in [[Genesis 22|the next chapter]].
