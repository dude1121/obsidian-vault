In [[Vector Calculus|vector calculus]], the **gradient** operation is an [[Vector|vector]] operation which takes [[Partial Derivative|partial derivatives]] of each of the vector's components. It produces a vector in turn. It is denoted with a the [[Del Operator|del operator]] $\nabla$. That is, for a vector function $a$ we define its gradient as
$$
\nabla a=(\frac{\partial a}{\partial x}\hat{\imath}+\frac{\partial a}{\partial y}\hat{\jmath}+\frac{\partial a}{\partial z}\hat{k})
$$
We can geometrically the gradient function by stating that,

Put another way, imagine you are standing on a hillside. If you look towards the direction of steepest ascent, that is the *direction* of the gradient of the hillside. The slope in that direction is the *magnitude* of the gradient. If the gradient was zero, that is, $\nabla T=0$, this would represent some stationary point, perhaps the plateau of the hill.
