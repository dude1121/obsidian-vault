**Indium nitride** (InN) is a [[Semiconductor|semiconductor]] compound made of [[Indium|indium]] and [[Nitrogen|nitrogen]]. As a semiconductor, InN has a very small [[Band Gap|band gap]] (~$0.7\pu{ eV}$) making it potentially useful for solar cells and high speed electronics. Indium nitride can be bonded with [[Gallium Nitride|gallium nitride]] (GaN) to form [[Indium Gallium Nitride]] (InGaN), a semiconductor used in green and blue [[LED|LEDs]].
