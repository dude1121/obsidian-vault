![[NBC Term - Access to exit]]
![[NBC Term - Exit]]
![[NBC Term - Public corridor]]
## 3.2.7.1. Minimum Lighting Requirements  
> **(1)** An *exit*, a *public corridor*, or a corridor providing *access to exit* for the public or serving patients' sleeping rooms or classrooms shall be equipped to provide illumination to an average level not less than $50\ \mathrm{lx}$ at floor or tread level and at angles and intersections at changes of level where there are stairs or *ramps*.  
> 
> **(2)** The minimum level of the illumination required by Sentence (1) shall be $10\ \mathrm{lx}$. ($0.93\ \mathrm{fc}$)
> 
> **(3)** Rooms and spaces used by the public shall be equipped to provide illumination as described in Sentences (4) to (7) and Article 9.34.2.7.  
> 
> **(4)** The minimum level of illumination over the entire length of escalators and moving walks shall be not less than $100\ \mathrm{lx}$ ($9.29\ \mathrm{fc}$) at the level of the treads and walking surfaces.  
> 
> **(5)** Except as provided in Sentence (6) and except for light switches and internally illuminated controls, the minimum level of illumination at controls required by Article 3.8.2.6. shall be not less than $100\ \mathrm{lx}$ ($9.29\ \mathrm{fc}$).  
> 
> **(6)** Where visual information is provided at controls referred to in Sentence (5), the minimum level of illumination at the controls shall be not less than $200\ \mathrm{lx}$ ($18.58\ \mathrm{fc}$), except where the visual information is internally illuminated.  
> 
> **(7)** Except for internally illuminated signs, the minimum level of illumination at signs displaying visual information required by specified clauses shall be not less than $200\ \mathrm{lx}$ ($18.58\ \mathrm{fc}$).  
## 3.2.7.2. Emergency Lighting  
> **(1)** An emergency lighting system shall be installed to provide illumination to an average level not less than $10\ \mathrm{lx}$ at floor or tread level in exits and access-to-exit corridors.  
> 
> **(2)** The minimum level of illumination for emergency lighting shall be $1\ \mathrm{lx}$ ($0.09\ \mathrm{fc}$).  
> 
> **(3)** Emergency lighting shall be designed to operate continuously for at least $30\ \mathrm{min}$ during a power failure.  
## 3.2.7.3. Emergency Power for Lighting  
> **(1)** Emergency lighting shall be supplied by batteries, generators, or a combination thereof capable of operating under load for at least $30\ \mathrm{min}$.  
> 
> **(2)** Emergency power supply shall automatically assume the connected load within $10\ \mathrm{s}$ after the failure of the normal power supply.  
## 3.2.7.4. Emergency Power for Fire Alarm Systems  
> **(1)** Fire alarm systems shall be provided with an emergency power supply capable of operating the system for at least $24\ \mathrm{h}$ in non-alarm condition, followed by $5\ \mathrm{min}$ in full alarm.  
## 3.2.7.5. Emergency Power for Other Life Safety Systems  
> **(1)** Emergency power shall be provided for smoke control, fire pumps, elevators for firefighters, and other emergency systems as required by this Code.  
## 3.2.7.6. Emergency Generator Requirements  
> **(1)** Where an emergency generator is used as a power supply for life safety systems, it shall be installed to CAN/CSA standards and located in a room separated by a fire separation having a fire-resistance rating of not less than $2\ \mathrm{h}$.  
> 
> **(2)** The generator shall be provided with a fuel supply sufficient for at least $2\ \mathrm{h}$ of full-load operation.  
## 3.2.7.7. Transfer Switches  
> **(1)** Transfer switches used to transfer life safety system loads to an emergency power supply shall be automatic and conform to CSA standards.  
## 3.2.7.8. Emergency Power for Voice Communication and Signal Systems  
> **(1)** Voice communication systems and visible/audible signal devices forming part of a fire alarm system shall be provided with emergency power for the duration specified in [[#3.2.7.4. Emergency Power for Fire Alarm Systems|Article 3.2.7.4.]]  
## 3.2.7.9. Emergency Power for Areas of Refuge  
> **(1)** Emergency power shall be provided for two-way communication and lighting in areas of refuge for the duration specified for emergency lighting.  
## 3.2.7.10. Protection of Electrical Conductors  
> **(1)** The protection of electrical and emergency conductors referred to in Clauses (a) to (c) shall conform to Sentences (2) to (11):  
> <span>&emsp;</span>a) electrical conductors located within high buildings serving fire alarms, emergency lighting, or emergency equipment,  
> <span>&emsp;</span>b) emergency conductors serving fire pumps,  
> <span>&emsp;</span>c) electrical conductors serving mechanical systems in areas of refuge or contained use areas.  
> 
> **(2)** Conductors identified in Sentence (1) shall either  
> <span>&emsp;</span>a) conform to CAN/ULC-S139 with a circuit integrity rating of not less than 1 h, or  
> <span>&emsp;</span>b) be located in a service space separated by a 1 h fire separation.  
> 
> **(3)** Conductors in Clause (1)(c) shall meet the same requirements but with a 2 h rating.  
> 
> **(4)** The service spaces referred to shall not contain combustible materials other than the protected conductors.  
> 
> **(5)** Protection requirements apply to conductors extending from the source of emergency power to the equipment served or the distribution equipment in the same room.  
> 
> **(6)** If a fire alarm transponder or annunciator in one fire compartment is connected to another in a different compartment, connecting conductors shall be protected as in Sentence (2).  
> 
> **(7)** Fire alarm system branch circuits within a storey connecting transponders to individual devices need not meet Sentence (2).  
> 
> **(8)** Conduits enclosing conductors required to have circuit integrity shall be noncombustible and not reduce the cableâ€™s fire-resistance rating.  
> 
> **(9)** Junction boxes and enclosures on these circuits shall be noncombustible and fire-stopped.  
> 
> **(10)** Penetrations for conductors shall be fire-stopped to maintain the fire-resistance rating of the assembly penetrated.  
> 
> **(11)** Repairs to fire-rated cable systems shall restore original fire-resistance performance.
