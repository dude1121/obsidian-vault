An **ion** is an [[Atom|atom]] or [[Molecule|molecule]] that has a net positive or negative [[Charge|charge]]. If the ion has a positive charge it is called a *cation* and if it has a negative charge it is called an *anion*. An ion has a charge because the number of [[Proton|protons]] is not equal to the number of [[Electron|electrons]]. 

Ions are denoted with a superscript. If the symbol is just $+$ or $-$, this indicates a charge of $+1$ or $-1$. Else, the charge will be written as $2+$ or $3-$. For example, $\ce{O_{2}^{2-}}$ for a [[Peroxide|peroxide]] with a net charge of $-2$.

Atoms become ions by either losing or gaining an electron. The amount of [[Energy|energy]] required to free an electron from its atom is called its [[Ionization|ionization]] energy. In general, this energy level is much lower in [[Metals|metals]] than it is in [[Non-Metals|non-metals]], which is why metals tend to become cations and non-metals tend to become anions. These cations and anions can [[Ionic Bond|bond]] together to form an [[Ionic Compound|ionic compound]].

Two things to note here. 1) Mercury(I) always forms an ionic bond with itself to create $\ce{Hg_{2}^{2+}}$ ions, but mercury(I) and mercury(II) are distinct ions. 2) Silver, Zinc, and Cadmium can only form one type of ion, so roman numerals are not necessary for these ions.

Some ions are not atoms but are molecules. These are called [[Polyatomic Ion|polyatomic ions]].
