**Friction** is a [[Force|force]] that results from the interaction of an object and its surroundings. Frictional forces resist an object's [[Motion|motion]]. Friction can be either *static* or *kinetic*. Static friction is the frictional force that prevents an object from moving at all, and only exists when the object is at rest. It is equal to the force applied to the object until a certain maximum force, given by,
$$
f_{s(max)}=\mathbf{\vec{n}}\mu_{s}
$$
where $\mathbf{\vec{n}}$ is the [[Normal Force|normal force]] of the object and $\mu_{s}$ is the [[Coefficient of Static Friction|coefficient of static friction]]. Once the object is in motion, the force of friction remains relatively constant, and it is now known as the *kinetic friction*. This value is given by,
$$
f_{k}=\mathbf{\vec{n}}\mu_{k}
$$
where $\mu_{k}$ is the [[Coefficient of Kinetic Friction|coefficient of kinetic friction]]. 

Frictional forces typically do negative [[Work|work]], since the force of friction is in opposition to the direction of motion. [[Energy]] lost due to friction typically result in an increase in the two object's [[Internal Energy|internal energy]].
