[[Genesis 2|Next]]
# Summary
- *1* God creates [[Heaven|heaven]] and earth.
- *2* There is a "wind from God". [[King James Version|KJV]] says "spirit of God."
- *3, 4*. Light and dark are created.
- *6*. A "dome" is placed in the midst of the waters. KJV calls this a "[[Firmament|firmament]]", [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]] calls it an "expanse."
	- In the [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]], this dome is called "sky" but most translations call it "heaven."
- *11, 12*. Plants and vegetation are created.
- *17*. The sun and the moon are placed within the "dome." 
	- This is a very [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] view.
- *20 - 25*. **All** animals are created.
	- Text says "of every kind."
- *26*. God makes "humankind" (Heb. *adam* אדם)
	- "Let us". [[Jehovah's Witnesses|JWs]] say this is God and [[Jesus]]. There is not evident proof *for* this claim but also nothing directly *against* it.
- *27*. God creates both male and female together.
# Thoughts
There is not much in Genesis 1 that raises many concerns on their own. The idea of the expanse being a dome is rarely touched on in JW literature. It contributes to a very archaic view of the earth and does not agree with science. How did this dome come about? Where did it go? How were the 'upper waters' staying there? If God's purpose is to bring mankind back to how it was at creation, will this be part of it?

It clearly seems like the author of Genesis (be it Moses or, as the [[New Oxford Annotated Bible|NOAB]] says, the [[Documentary Hypothesis|Yahwist]] author) held that the earth was flat, as a 'dome' wouldn't cover a spherical earth.

Verse 27 also clearly has male and female humans created together. It seems, as the NOAB suggests, there are 2 stories told about creation. Genesis 1 is the first, with [[Genesis 2]] being the other.
