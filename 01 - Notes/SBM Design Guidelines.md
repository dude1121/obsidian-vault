| :-: | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| XA  | Pole mounted fixture                                     |
| XB  | Building mounted fixture (e.g. wall packs, sconces, etc) |
| XC  | Building mounted fixture above exterior doors            |
| XD  | Downlights under canopies                                |
| XE  | Bollards                                                 |
| XF  | Spotlight                                                |

### Canopies
>[!tip] Typical Illuminance:  ~ $5\ \mathrm{fc}$

Canopy lighting is commonly surface, pendant, or recessed mounted to a structure's ceiling, soffit, or overhang. This is generally used to provide illumination to areas for vehicle and pedestrian use. Architectural drawings will typically show the outline and elevation of canopies. **To start** try spacing 2-4 potlights about $1.8\ \mathrm{m}$ ($6\ \mathrm{ft.}$) apart. 
### Walkways
>[!tip] Typical Illuminance: ~ $2\ \mathrm{fc}$

Walkway lighting serves several purposes from keeping pedestrians safe to enhancing the visual appearance of the face of a building. Bollards, columns, or shorter pole-mounted lights are often used to accomplish this. If the walkway is close to the building, wall mounted lights may also be used as walkway lighting. 
### Driveways
>[!tip] Typical Illuminance: ~ $1\ \mathrm{fc}$

Driveway fixtures prevent drivers from driving into a dark space before reaching the parking lot. These fixtures can not extend beyond the property line meaning they must be positioned close to the property with wide distributions. Driveway fixtures typically match the fixtures in parking lots. 
### Parking lots
>[!tip] Typical Illuminance: ~ $1\ \mathrm{fc}$

Pole mounted fixtures are the most commonly used type for parking lots. These fixtures are normally placed on islands, along the outline of the parking lot, or in between parking spaces.
### Entrances / Emergency Exits
>[!tip] Typical Illuminance: Exits ~ $1\ \mathrm{fc}$, Entrances ~ $1\ \mathrm{fc}$

Wall mounted fixtures above emergency exit doors serve to illuminate the path of exit. Most designs will utilize building-mounted fixtures along the side of the building to light up a path. Always add a fixture above an entrance/exit. This may cause there to be an excessive amount of light at these points but this is expected.
