**Charles' law** is a law that states that the [[Volume|volume]] of a gas is proportional to its [[Temperature|temperature]]. 
$$
V\propto T
$$
$$
V=bT
$$
where $b$ is a proportionality constant and $T$ is the temperature in [[Kelvin|kelvin]] $[\pu{ K}]$. Together along with [[Boyle's Law|Boyle's law]] and [[Avogadro's Law|Avogadro's law]], this law makes up part of the [[Ideal Gas Law|ideal gas law]].
