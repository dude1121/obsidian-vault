Electric **charge** is a property of [[Matter|matter]] that causes it to experience a [[Force|force]] when placed in an [[Electric Field|electric]] or [[Magnetic Field|magnetic field]] (often combined into one [[Electromagnetic Field|electromagnetic field]]). Charge can be *positive* or *negative* with like charges repelling one another and opposite charges attracting one another. If something does not have any net charge we call it *electrically neutral*. 

The [[Units of Measurement|unit of measurement]] for charge is the [[Coulomb]] $[\text{C}]$.
