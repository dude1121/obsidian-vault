**Admittance** is the inverse of [[Impedance|impedance]]. It is made up of both real and [[Complex Numbers|imaginary]] parts, the [[conductance]] and [[susceptance]], respectively. It is typically denoted with $Y$ and it is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Siemens]] $[\text{S}]$.
$$
Y=G+jB
$$
$$
Y=Z^{-1}
$$
