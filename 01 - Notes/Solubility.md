**Solubility** is the ability of a substance (the *solute*) to form a solution with another substance (the *solvent*). 

# Salts in Water

For various [[Ionic Compound|salts]], there are some rules that can be followed to determine how well a given salt will dissolve in [[Water|water]].
1. Most [[Nitrate|nitrate]] $\ce{NO_{3}-}$ salts are soluble.
2. Most salts containing the [[Alkali Metal|alkali metal]] ions ($\ce{Li+}$,$\ce{Na+}$,$\ce{K+}$,$\ce{Rb+}$, and $\ce{Cs+}$) and the [[Ammonium|ammonium]] ion $\ce{NH_{4}+}$ are soluble.
3. Most chloride, bromide, and iodide salts are soluble. The exception to this is if the compound contains the ions $\ce{Ag+}$, $\ce{Pb^{2+}}$, and $\ce{Hg_{2}^{2+}}$.
4. Most [[Sulfate|sulfate]] salts are soluble. Notable exceptions include $\ce{BaSO_{4}}$, $\ce{PbSO_{4}}$, $\ce{Hg_{2}SO_{4}}$, and $\ce{CaSO_{4}}$.
5. Most [[Hydroxide|hydroxides]] are only slightly soluble. Important soluble hydroxides include $\ce{NaOH}$ and $\ce{KOH}$. $\ce{Ba(OH)2}$, $\ce{Sr(OH)2}$, and $\ce{Ca(OH)2}$ are marginally soluble.
6. Most sulfide, carbonate, chromate, and phosphate salts are only slightly soluble, unless they contain the ions in rule 2.
