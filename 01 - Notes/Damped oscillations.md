**Damped oscillations** are [[Simple harmonic motion|oscillations]] that occur in the presence of some [[Retarding Force|retarding force]] $\mathbf{\vec{R}}$, typically friction of some sort. This damping reduces the total [[Mechanical Energy|mechanical energy]] in the system and therefore leads to the oscillations dying out if no additional energy is added to the system.
