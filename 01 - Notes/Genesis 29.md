[[Genesis 28|Previous]] [[Genesis 30|Next]]
# Summary
- *1 - 8*. Like [[Rebekah]] before her, [[Rachel]] is first seen at a well. Rachel is [[Laban]]'s daughter which makes her [[Jacob]]'s first cousin.
	- Unlike the story with Rebekah, Jacob is the one who sees Rachel first, not his father's servant.
- *10*. The well Jacob sees Rachel at has a large stone that blocks the well's mouth which shepherds move to allow their flocks to drink. Jacob moves this stone by himself here after seeing Rachel.
	- This foreshadows Jacob's incredible physical strength (see [[Genesis 32]])
- *11*. Jacob then kisses Rachel (?) after moving the stone and begins to weep.
	- Why?
- *12*. Now Jacob informs Rachel that she is his cousin.
- *13*. Laban is happy with these developments and also kisses Jacob.
- *14*. Laban says that Jacob is his "bone" and his "flesh", echoing [[Adam]]'s words to [[Eve]] (see [[Genesis 2]]). But, like, why?
- *17*. [[Leah]] has "weak" eyes (according to the [[JPS Tanakh|Tanakh]]). [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]] translates this as "her eyes were lovely" but there is a note that the Hebrew translation is unclear here.
- *18*. Jacob vows to serve Laban for seven years in exchange for Rachel's hand in marriage.
>[!quote] Genesis 29.20
>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.

- *20*. This is a sweet sentiment and all, but let us not forget that he decided to do this having only known Rachel maybe a couple days if we're being generous with the timeline.
- *21*. Some time later, Jacob asks to marry Rachel.
- *23*. Laban pranks Jacob and gives him Leah instead.
- *25*. Jacob some how does not notice until the next morning that he slept with Leah and not Rachel.
- *26 - 27*. Laban says it is uncustomary to give away the younger daughter before the firstborn. He offers another seven years of servitude in exchange for Rachel (for realsies this time).
- *30*. Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah.
- *31*. God makes Rachel barren. This again parallels Rebekah and [[Sarah]] before her.
- *32 - 35*. Leah has 4 children: [[Reuben (Person)|Reuben]], [[Simeon (Person)|Simeon]], [[Levi (Person)|Levi]], and [[Judah (Person)|Judah]]. 
# Thoughts
Jacob's life seems to be recorded to echo [[Abraham|Abraham's]] and [[Isaac|Isaac's]] closely. Also, Jacob is unbelievable for not recognizing Leah.

The life of the patriarchs is just lie after lie so I guess Jacob being tricked by Laban is fitting. I also don't understand how God allowed polygamy. If his purpose was one man and one woman, why were these "faithful men of old" blessed by God despite having concubines and multiple wives?

It seems like the moral standards were retroactively imposed on God. After all, the one wife thing wasn't introduced until the [[New Testament|NT]].
