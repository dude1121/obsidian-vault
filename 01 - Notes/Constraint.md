A **constraint** in project management is a limiting factor of a [[Project|project]]. Examples include:
- [[Cost]]
- [[Scheduling|Time / Scheduling]]
- [[Project Scope|Scope]]
- [[Project Resources|Resources]]

The three important constraints, called the *triple constraint*, consist of *time*, *cost*, and *scope*. Losses in any one of these three areas will result in a hit to the project's *quality*.
