The **angular momentum** of a rotating body is the angular counterpart to [[Linear Momentum|linear momentum]]. It is measured in [[Kilogram|kilogram]]-[[Metre|metres]] squared per [[Second|second]] $[\text{kg}\cdot \text{m}^2/s]$ and is typically assigned the symbol $\mathbf{\vec{L}}$. Angular momentum is a [[Vector|vector]] quantity.
