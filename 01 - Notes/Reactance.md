**Reactance** is a form of *opposition* present in non-[[Resistance|resistive]] components: [[Inductor|inductors]] and [[Capacitor|capacitors]] and is the [[Complex Numbers|imaginary]] part of [[Impedance|impedance]]. It is the response of a component when exposed to an alternating voltage. Unlike resistance, reactance varies with frequency. It is typically denoted with an $X$ and it is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Ohm]] $[\Omega]$. Whereas resistance is related to energy dissipated as [[Heat|heat]], reactance is related to energy stored by these components (see [[Reactive Power]]). 

Reactance is a [[Vector|vector quantity]]. Its direction is determined by the type of component producing the reactance. Recall that an inductor will make the current *lag* the voltage and a capacitor will make the current *lead* the voltage. This is due to the reactance of these components. 

An inductor's reactance has a direction of $90\degree$, whereas a capacitor's reactance has a direction of $-90\degree$. If the total reactance of a circuit has a direction of $\theta>0$, we say it is *primarily inductive*, whereas if $\theta<0$, the circuit is *primarily capacitive*. As frequency increases, inductive reactance increases, and capacitive reactance decreases.

The inverse of reactance is [[Susceptance|susceptance]].
