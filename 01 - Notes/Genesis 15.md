[[Genesis 14|Previous]] [[Genesis 16|Next]]
# Summary
- *2*. Eliezar of [[Damascus]] is an unknown figure, likely a slave born in [[Abraham|Abram]]'s home, as verse 3 says.
- *5*. God promises to make Abram's seed as numerous as the stars.
- *7*. God mentions Abram coming out of [[Ur]], but in [[Genesis 12|chapter 12]] it seemed he came out of Harran.
- *10 - 11*. Abram cuts the animals in half and walks through them, an old way of concluding a pact or [[Covenant|covenant]]. The word for "making" a covenant literally means to "cut" a covenant.  
- *13 - 14*. God tells Abram that his offspring will be slaves for 400 years.
- *16*. In the "fourth generation," Abram's offspring will return.
# Thoughts
This archaic covenant practice is largely unmentioned in JW publications.
