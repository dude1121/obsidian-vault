The **Ampere** is the [[Units of Measurement|SI base unit]] for [[Current|electric current]]. It is formally defined as,

>[!quote] 1 Ampere
>The ampere is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the [[Elementary Charge]], $e$, to be $1.602176634\times 10^{-19}$ when expressed in the unit $\text{C}$, which is equal to $\text{A}\cdot \text{s}$, where the [[Second|second]] is defined in terms of $\Delta v_{\text{Cs}}$.

It can also be defined as a [[Coulomb]] per second.

$$
	1\text{A}=\frac{1\text{C}}{1\text{s}}
$$
