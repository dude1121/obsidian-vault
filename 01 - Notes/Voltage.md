**Voltage** is a measure of the “pressure” difference between positive and negative [charges](Charge.md). We also call this a difference in _electrical potential_. It is [[Units of Measurement|measured]] in [[Volts]] \[$\text{V}$].

If a total of $1\text{J}$ of work is used to move a charge of $1\text{C}$ of [electrons](Electron), we say there is an electrical potential difference of $1\text{V}$. $1\text{C}$ is defined as the amount of charge present in $6.242\times10^{18}$ electrons. That is,
$$ 1\text{C}\equiv6.242\times10^{18}\text{ e}^\text{-} $$
We can therefore define voltage as,
$$ V=\frac{W}{Q} $$
