A **light fixture** or **lamp** is a device that emits [[Light|light]] when powered. They are typically directly wired but occasionally can be plugged into a [[Receptacle|receptacle]].
# Types
## Incandescent
Incandescent lamps produce light by heating a thin wire called a *filament* by passing a [[Current|current]] through it. When heated, this filament glows producing light. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either [[Vacuum|evacuated]] or filled with an [[Inert Gas|inert gas]] that protects the filament from [[Chemical Reaction#Oxidation-Reduction Reactions|oxidation]]. Incandescent lights run on line [[Voltage|voltage]] and thus require no external equipment to operate. This makes them very cheap to produce, however incandescent lamps are incredibly [[Efficiency|inefficient]] (producing around $16$ [[Lumen|lumens]] per [[Watt|watt]]).
## Fluorescent
A fluorescent lamp is a low-pressure [[Mercury (Element)|mercury]]-vapour gas-discharge lamp that uses [[Fluorescence|fluorescence]] to produce visible light. A current is sent through the gas in the lamp that excites the vapour causing it to produce [[Ultraviolet|UV]] radiation and makes the [[Phosphor|phosphor]] coating inside the lamp glow. These fixtures are much more efficient than incandescent fixtures but are less efficient than LED lamps (producing around $50-100$ lumens per watt).

Fluorescent lamps require a ballast to power the lamp and regulate the voltage across the bulb, as once the mercury has begun to conduct the voltage does not need to be as high as before.  This is because fluorescent lamps are negative differential [[Resistance|resistance]] devices, so as more current flows through them their resistance drops. A constant voltage would therefore destroy a fluorescent fixture. This requirement for a ballast makes them much more costly than incandescent lamps. There are two main kinds of ballasts used: electric (or, solid state) and electromagnetic. Electric ballasts have next to no losses, whereas an electromagnetic ballast has losses up to $10\%$ of the applied voltage which is a higher rate of losses for the same lumen output, making solid state ballasts much more attractive.
### Compact Fluorescent Lamps
## High Intensity Discharge
### Metal Halide
A metal-halide lamp produces light by creating an [[Electric Arc|arc]] through a gaseous mixture of vapourized mercury and [[Metal Halide|metal halides]]. These lights typically produce white light and, like other HID lamps, are very high power. Metal-halide lamps have an efficacy of about $75-100$ lumens per watt which is much better than incandescent lamps and slightly better than some worse performing fluorescent lamps.

Metal-halide lamps produce very high [[Colour Rendering Index|CRI]] light. As such, they are very often used as wide area overhead lighting for commercial, industrial, and public places.
### High Pressure Sodium
High pressure sodium lamps (or, *sodium-vapour lamps*)  are gas-discharge lamps that use [[Sodium|sodium]] in an excited state to produce light at a [[Wavelength|wavelength]] of approximately $\lambda =589\pu{ nm}$. Low-pressure sodium lights do exist but their characteristic yellow light restricts them to outdoor lighting like street lamps. High-pressure lamps emit a broader spectrum of light than the low-pressure lamps but still have poorer colour-rendering.

HPS lamps are widely used in industrial lighting and plant growing lights. These lamps are quite efficient at around $100$ lumens per watt but there are some bulbs that achieve efficacies of up to $150$ lumens per watt.
