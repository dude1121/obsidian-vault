The **load regulation** of a circuit specifies how much change occurs in the output [[Voltage|voltage]] over a certain range of load current values, usually from minimum current (i.e. "no-load") to maximum current (i.e. "full-load"). 
$$
\text{Load Regulation}=\left(\frac{V_{NL}-V_{FL}}{V_{FL}}\right) \cdot 100\%
$$
