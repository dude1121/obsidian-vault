- [[Socrates]] is held in prison after his trial on the isle of Delos. His friend, [[Crito (Person)|Crito]], visits him here in secret to make another attempt to convince Socrates to run away and not submit to the court's ruling.
# Capacity for [[Good & Evil|good / evil]]
>[!quote] Crito p.47
>**Socrates**: My good Crito, why should we care so much for what the majority think? The most reasonable people, to whom one should pay more attention, will believe that things were done as they were done.

>**Crito**: You see, Socrates, that one must also pay attention to the opinion of the majority. Your present situation makes clear that the majority can inflict not the least but pretty well the greatest evils if one is slandered among them.

>**Socrates**: Would that the majority could inflict the greatest evils, for they would then be capable of the greatest good, and that would be fine, but now they cannot do either. They cannot make a man either wise or foolish, but they inflict things haphazardly. 

Socrates raises an interesting point here. Can one do good if they do not have the capacity to do evil? Does this apply solely to those in positions of authority or does this apply to the individual as well? Can an individual truly do good acts if they do not simultaneously contain the ability to do evil acts?

The root of the question here is really: are good acts good because they accomplish good things? Or are they good because one *chose* to do good when they could have done bad? If one has a very great capacity for evil and only does a little good, is this act good at all?

I relate this to the example of a billionaire donating thousands of dollars to charity. Donating to charity is a good thing, but if the person has the ability to donate much more than what they donate, is it really a *good* act?

This is similar to the debate in [[Euthyphro]] about whether an act is good because the gods love it or if the gods love the act because it is good / pious. 
# Why Socrates will not flee
>[!quote] Crito p. 52
>**Socrates**: Do we say that one must never in any way do wrong willingly, or must one do wring in one way and not in another? Is to do wrong never good and admirable, as we have agreed in the past, or have all these former agreements been washed out during the last few days? Have we at our age failed to notice for some time that in our serious discussions we were no different from children? Above all, is the truth such as we used to say it was, whether the majority agree or not, and whether we must still suffer worse things than we do now, or will be treated more gently, that, nonetheless, wrongdoing or injustice is in every way harmful and shameful to the wrongdoer? Do we say so or not?

>**Crito**: We do.

>**Socrates**: So one must never do wrong.

>**Crito**: Certainly not.

>**Socrates**: Nor must one, when wronged, inflict wrong in return, as the majority believe, since one must never do wrong.
