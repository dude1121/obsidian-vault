The **oxidation state** or **oxidation number** of an [[Atom|atom]] in a [[Covalent Bond|covalent]] [[Compound|compound]] relates to its relative number of "shared" [[Electron|electrons]]. In compounds where the atoms are different the electrons are shared unequally. We therefore assume that the atoms that have a stronger attraction for electrons (a higher [[Electronegativity|electronegativity]]) receive *all* the shared electrons. 

For example, in a [[Water|water]] [[Molecule|molecule]], the bonded electrons are unevenly shared between the [[Oxygen|oxygen]] and [[Hydrogen|hydrogen]] atoms. Since oxygen is more electronegative, it attracts the electrons more, and therefore it has a partial negative [[Charge|charge]]. We say then that the oxygen has "taken" the electrons giving it an excess of 2 electrons, and leaving the hydrogen atoms each with a deficit of 1 electron. The oxidation state of the oxygen is then $-2$, and the oxidation state of the hydrogen is $+1$.

To assign oxidation states to a molecule we apply the rule that for an electrically neutral atom, the oxidation states must be zero. For an ion, the sum of the oxidation states must equal the charge of the ion.
