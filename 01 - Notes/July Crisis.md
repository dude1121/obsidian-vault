The **July Crisis** is a term given to the period beginning with the [[Assassination of Franz Ferdinand]] on June 28, 1914 and ending with the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914.
# Timeline
- **28 June**. [[Franz Ferdinand]] and his wife Sophie are assassinated on a tour of Sarajevo by [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of the terrorist group [[The Black Hand]].
- **1 July**. German publicist Victor Naumann contacts the head of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Foreign Ministry, Count Hoyos. He tells Hoyos the mentality then prevailing in leading German political circles. Naumann communicates that [[German Empire|Germany]] felt the [[Central Powers|Triple Alliance]] was not strong enough for war but the Anglo-German settlement in Africa would 'make it certain that Britain would not intervene in a European war.' Naumann counsels that Austria should go ahead with war plans, implying that unlike the Moroccan crises, the Kaiser would not shy from war.
- **4 July**. The Austrian Foreign Ministry is unofficially told that "Germany would support the Monarchy through thick and thin, whatever action is decided to take against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. The sooner it hit Austria-Hungary struck, the better."
- **5 July**. Szőgyény is handed two documents: a memorandum detailing the Monarchy's situation along with a proposal that Bulgaria should join the triple alliance, and a letter from [[Franz Joseph I]] detailing his opinion that the only way to save the Monarchy was to "eliminate Serbia" in order to avoid the "Pan-Slav flood."
	- The Kaiser is handed these documents and at first he evades making a decision, but afterwards he informs Szőgyény to alert the emperor that Austria-Hungary could "count on Germany's full support" even in the case of war. He adds that "as things stood today, Russia was not at all ready for war, and would certainly think long before appealing to arms." This is known as Germany's [[Germany's Blank Cheque|blank cheque]].
- **20-23 July**. The French president and premier both visit [[Russian Empire|Russia]] on a state visit.
- **20 July**. The Austro-Hungarian cabinet produces an ultimatum to send to Serbia. They wait to send it to Serbia though to wait for the state visit to conclude so France and Russia can not coordinate their response.
- **23 July**. The [[Ultimatum to Serbia, 1914|ultimatum]] is sent to Serbia with a 48-hour time limit.
- **24 July**. When they hear about the ultimatum, Russia resolves to stand behind Serbia should it come to war.

	- Austria assures Russia that it will not seize any Serbian territory.

- **27 July**. France issues standby mobilization orders.
- **28 July**. Austria declares war on Serbia.
	- The Austrians are not yet fully ready for war, but they were worried the talks throughout Europe could lead to someone jumping to war before them.
	- Germany and England urge Austria to simply occupy Belgrade and then begin talks again.
	- Russia orders a general mobilization
		- [[Wilhelm II]] contacts the [[Nicholas II|Tsar]] and convinces him to back down, citing pressure that Germany is also putting pressure on Austria to get them to back off.
		- Nicholas II agrees and orders only a partial mobilization against Austria but not Germany.

- **2 August**. The British cabinet offers France assurances that Britain would protect the French coasts.
	- German troops march through Luxembourg and the German ambassador to Belgium demands military access. Belgium declines.
- **3 August**. Germany declares war on France.
- **4 August**. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] declares war on Germany citing the violating of the [[Treaty of 1839]] as their *cassus belli*.
	- Germany as a result declares war on Belgium.
- **6 August**. Austria finally declares war on Russia.
