The **ripple factor** of a [[Rectifier|rectifier]] is a value that expresses how well a rectified output is filtered. It is given by,
$$
r=\frac{V_{r-pp}}{V_{DC}}\cdot 100\%
$$
where $V_{DC}$ is the average value of the unfiltered output and $V_{r-pp}$ is the peak-to-peak value of the filtered output.
