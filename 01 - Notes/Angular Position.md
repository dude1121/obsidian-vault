**Angular position** is the [[Angle|angle]] through which a given body rotates around a centre or axis of rotation. It is typically denoted with $\theta$, $\vartheta$, or $\varphi$ and it is traditionally measured in [[Radian|radians]] although sometimes units like [[Degree|degrees]] are used. To define an angular position, we define some reference line that connects the axis of rotation $O$ to a chosen particle. The angular position is therefore defined as the angle $\theta$ between the reference line and the fixed reference line in space, typically the x axis. 

If the object has some change in angular position, we call this change $\Delta \theta$ and define it as,
$$
\Delta \theta=\theta_{f}-\theta_{i}
$$
This quantity is known as the *angular displacement*. Taking the [[Time|time]] [[Derivative|derivative]] of this displacement yields the [[Angular Velocity|angular velocity]]. 
$$
\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}
