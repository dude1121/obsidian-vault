## 12-100 Types of insulated conductors and cables
> 1) Insulated conductors and cables shall be suitable for the location in which they will be installed with respect to, but not limited to, 
	a) moisture, if any;
	b) temperature;
	c) degree of enclosure; and
	d) degree of mechanical protection.
> 2) Where harmful condensed vapours or liquids of either an acid or alkaline nature, or organic solvents such as hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, alcohols, or their liquid derivatives, can collect on or come in contact with the insulation, jacket, or covering on conductors or cables, such insulation, jacket, or covering shall be of a type resistant to these substances, or the insulation shall be protected by a sheath of lead or by other material impervious to the corrosive element.
## 12-102 Installation of insulated conductors and cables
> 1) Insulated conductors and cables shall not be handled or installed when the ambient temperature is sufficiently low as to be liable to cause damage to the insulation.
> 2) Such insulated conductors and cables shall not be installed so as to permit flexing or movement of the conductors or cables after installation if the ambient temperature is liable to become low enough to damage the insulation during flexing or movement.
> 3) Except as permitted by other Rules of this Code, insulated conductors and cables shall be of the types specified in [[CEC t.19|Table 19]] for the specific condition of use.
> 4) Except as permitted by other Rules of this Code, flexible cords, portable power cables, and equipment wire shall be of the types specified in [[CEC t.11A|Table 11A]] for the specific condition of use.

> 5) [[Flexible Cable|Flexible cords]], heater cords, tinsel cords, equipment wires, appliance wiring materials, Christmas tree cords, wind turbine cables, electric vehicle supply equipment cables, and dryer and range cable of the types specified in [[CEC t.11B|Table 11B]] shall not be used for general-purpose wiring.
![[CEC t.11B]]
	6) The maximum allowable conductor insulation temperature for T90 Nylon, when exposed to oil, shall be limited to $60\ \degree\mathrm{C}$.
	7) Conductor insulation shall be permitted for use where exposed to oil when marked as follows:
		a) PR I with the maximum allowable conductor insulation temperature limited to $60\ \degree\mathrm{C}$; and
		b) PR II with the maximum allowable conductor insulation temperature limited to $75\ \degree\mathrm{C}$.
	8) Conductor insulation shall be permitted for use when subjected to alkaline conditions in the presence of petroleum solvents, such as in oil refineries and around gasoline storage or pump areas, when marked as follows:
		a) GR I with the maximum allowable conductor insulation temperature limited to $60\ \degree\mathrm{C}$; and
		b) GR II with the maximum allowable conductor insulation temperature limited to $75\ \degree\mathrm{C}$.
## 12-116 Termination of conductors (see Appendix B)
> 1) Connection of conductors to terminal parts shall be made by means of pressure connectors, solder lugs, or splices to flexible leads.
> 2) The portion of stranded conductors to be held by binding-screw terminals or solderless wire connectors shall have the strands confined so that there will be no stray strands to cause either short-circuits or grounds.
> 3) Stranded and solid conductors No. 10 AWG and smaller shall be permitted to be connected by means of binding-screw terminals or studs and nuts that have upturned lugs or the equivalent.
> 4) Stranded and solid conductors larger than No. 10 AWG shall be terminated in solderless conductor connectors or shall be permitted to be soldered into conductor connectors suitable for the purpose, except where prohibited by [[CEC s.10|Section 10]].
> 5) Fine-strand conductors shall terminate in 
> 	a) connectors identified for use with fine-strand conductors; or
> 	b) standard connectors with the use of ferrules.
> 6) Ferrules shall not be used on solid conductors.
## 12-120 Supporting of conductors
> 1) Conductors shall be supported so that no damaging strain is imposed on the terminals of any electrical apparatus or devices or on joints or taps.
> 2) Conductors in vertical raceways shall be supported independently of the terminal connections and at intervals not exceeding those specified in Table 21, and such supports shall maintain the continuity of the raceway system without damage to the conductors or their covering.
> 3) Conductors in raceways shall not hang over the edges of bushings, bends, or fittings of any kind in such a manner that the insulation may be damaged.
> 4) Vertical runs of armoured or sheathed cable such as TECK90, RA90, RC90, AC90, and ACWU90 shall have the internal conductor assembly supported at intervals not exceeding those specified in [[CEC t.21|Table 21]], or by 
> 	a) incorporating a bend or bends equivalent to a total of not less than 90° at intervals not exceeding the distances specified in [[CEC t.21|Table 21]];
> 	b) installation of a horizontal run of the cable not less than the length of the vertical run; or
> 	c) use of cable that is specifically designed for vertical runs.
## 12-122 Equipment wire
> 1) Equipment wire shall be selected in accordance with [[CEC s.12#12-102 Installation of insulated conductors and cables|Rule 12-102]] 4) for the specific condition of use and shall be suitable for the particular location involved with respect to, but not limited to, 
> 	a) moisture;
	b) corrosive action;
	c) temperature;
	d) degree of enclosure; and
	e) exposure to mechanical damage.
> 2) Equipment wire used as luminaire wiring shall be not smaller than a No. 18 AWG copper conductor.
> 3) Equipment wire, including its assemblies for applications other than that given in Subrule 2), shall be not smaller than No. 26 AWG copper when rated $300\ \mathrm{V}$ and not smaller than No. 24 AWG copper when rated $600\ \mathrm{V}$.
# Installation of boxes, cabinets, outlets, and terminal fittings
## 12-3016 Outlet boxes, cabinets, and fittings
> 1) The front edges of boxes, cabinets, and fittings installed in walls or ceilings shall not be set in more than 6 mm from the finished surface and, where the walls or ceilings are of wood or other combustible material, shall be flush with the finished surface or shall project from the surface.
> 2) Gaps or open spaces in plaster surfaces of walls or ceilings shall be filled in around the front edges of boxes, cabinets, and fittings.
> 3) Outlet boxes requiring wet location cover plates shall be installed in a manner that the intended seal between the outlet box and the cover is ensured.
> 4) Flush boxes, cabinets, and fittings shall be of a type suitable for the intended location of installation.
