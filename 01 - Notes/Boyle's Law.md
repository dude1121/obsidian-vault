**Boyle's law** is a law that relates the [[Pressure|pressure]] and [[Volume|volume]] of a gas to some proportionality constant $k$. In other words, it shows that
$$
V\propto P^{-1}
$$
$$
PV=k
$$
This law holds at relatively low pressures, the exact limit for this depends on the gas itself. A gas that perfectly obeys Boyle's law is known as an *ideal gas* and is described by not only Boyle's law but also the [[Ideal Gas Law|ideal gas law]].
