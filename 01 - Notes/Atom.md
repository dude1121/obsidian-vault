An **Atom** is a fundamental particle of all chemical [[Elements|elements]]. It consists of three basic particles: the [[Nucleus|nucleus]], made up of [[Proton|protons]] and [[Neutron|neutrons]], and [[Electron|electrons]], which are arranged into orbits around the nucleus.

# Electron Shells

Each orbit has a corresponding energy level. These levels are designated 1, 2, 3, etc., with level 1 being the closest to the nucleus. These orbits are also known as "shells", which can all have varying amounts of electrons depending on their energy levels. The amount of electrons a given shell can hold is given by,
$$
N_{e}=2n^2
$$
where $N_{e}$ is the number of electrons and $n$ is the energy level of the shell.

The shell furthest from the nucleus is called the [[Valence Shell|valence shell]]. When a valence electron receives sufficient [[Energy|energy]] from an external source, it is able to break free from its orbit. The amount of energy required to do this is called the *ionization energy*. Losing or gaining an electron is referred to as [[Ionization|ionization]]. When atoms lost electrons they become a positively charged [[Ion|ion]] (cation) and when they gain electrons they become negatively charged ions (anions), since electrons are negatively [[Charge|charged]], and protons are positively charged. The escaped electron from a cation is called a *free electron*.

## The Quantum Model

Bohr's original model of the atom was a good approximation, but it is incorrect. The Quantum model is more accurate. Like Bohr's model, the quantum model has a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons. But the electrons are no longer in precise circular orbits. This is due to three important principles:
- [[Wave-Particle Duality]]. [[Elementary Particles|Elementary particles]] behave as both waves and particles. The velocity of an orbiting electron depends on its [[Wavelength|wavelength]] which in turn interferes with other nearby electrons.
- [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]]. Since a wave is not static and has peaks and valleys, electrons behaving as waves cannot be precisely identified in terms of their position. It is impossible to determine simultaneously both position & velocity of an electron with any degree of accuracy. Therefore, electrons are represented in probability clouds around the atom instead of precise circular orbits.
- [[Superposition Theorem (Quantum Mechanics)|Superposition]]. If the state of an object is unknown, it is said to be in all possible positions until it is observed.
In the quantum model, each shell consists of up to 4 subshells called [[Orbitals|orbitals]], denoted as  $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$.

Notation is as follows:

$1s^2\ \rightarrow$ 2 electrons in shell 1, orbital $s$
$2s^2\ 2p^3\ \rightarrow$ 5 electrons in shell 2, 2 in orbital $s$, and 3 in orbital $p$
