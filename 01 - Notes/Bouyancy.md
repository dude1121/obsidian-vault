**Buoyancy** is a force, directed upward, that is exerted by a [[Fluid|fluid]] on a submerged or floating object that opposes the [[Weight|weight]] of the object. The magnitude of the buoyant force acting on an object is equivalent to the weight of fluid that the object displaces. That is,
$$
B=m_{\ \text{fluid}}\ g
$$
This statement is known as [[Archimedes' Principle]]. This form is not as useful however as the mass of the displaced fluid is not always readily apparent. It is instead more often stated in terms of [[Density|density]] and [[Volume|volume]].
$$
\boxed{B=\rho_{\ \text{fluid}}\ gV}
$$
where $V=Ah$.
