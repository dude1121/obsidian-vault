The **band gap** is the amount of [[Energy|energy]] an [[Electron|electron]] requires to escape its valence band and jump into the conduction band, causing it to become a free electron.

An [[insulator]] requires a lot of energy for an electron to reach the conduction band, whereas a [[semiconductor]] does not require nearly as much. A [[conductor]] has an overlap between these bands, making it very easy for electrons to jump to the conduction band.

The band gap energy is typically measured in [[Electron Volts|electron volts]] $[\pu{eV}]$, and it varies from semiconductor to semiconductor. In a [[Silicon|silicon]] [[Atom|atom]], the band gap energy is $E=1.12\pu{ eV}$.
