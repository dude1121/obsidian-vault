In [[Electrodynamics|electrodynamics]], a **field point** is a point in [[Vector Space|vector space]] at which a given [[Electric Field|electric]] or [[Magnetic Field|magnetic]] field is calculated. A field point is typically given in conjunction with a corresponding [[Source Point|source point]]. The [[Vector|vector]] that points from the source point to the field point is called the [[Separation Vector|separation vector]] $\pmb{\mathtt{r}}$.
