A **solar cell** is a type of semiconductor that converts sunlight into [[Voltage|electrical potential]]. A [[Silicon|silicon]] solar cell consists of a thin wafer that has been doped to create a [[PN Junction|pn junction]]. The *n*-region of the wafer is much thinner than the *p*-region to allow for [[Light|light]] to penetrate the silicon. The construction is detailed below.

# Operating Principle

Sunlight is composed of [[Photon|photons]]. When a photon penetrates either the *n*-region or the *p*-region of the solar cell and strikes a silicon [[Atom|atom]] near the pn junction, it can knock the [[Electron|electron]] out of its orbit, promoting it from a valence electron to a conduction (or, free) electron. This leaves a [[Hole Current|hole]] in the valence band. Since the two regions are doped, the newly free electrons gather in the *n*-region and the holes gather in the *p*-region. This causes a voltage to develop across the depletion region of the solar cell. When a load is connected across the cell, the free electrons flow out of the *n*-region and into the load.

# Applications

A single solar cell can only produce about $E\approx 0.5\pu{ V}$. To make solar generation viable, the cells are arranged into large arrays, with each cell in series with one another, to produce a larger voltage.
