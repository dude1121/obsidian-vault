The **rest energy** of a particle or system is the [[Energy|energy]] that is independent of the system's [[Velocity|velocity]]. It is defined by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[Mass-Energy Equivalence|mass-energy equivalence]] equation,
$$
E_{R}=mc^2
$$
This follows because the total [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]] for a [[Relativity|relativistic particle]] is,
$$
K=(\gamma-1)mc^2
$$
where $\gamma$ is the [[Time Dilation|time dilation]] of the system. Since the $mc^2$ term is outside the brackets, it is independent of the time dilation and motion of the system, so we can isolate it.

This equation shows that [[Mass|mass]] is a form of energy. It also shows that a small mass corresponds to a very large amount of energy, something of importance when considering [[Nuclear Physics|nuclear]] and [[Elementary Particle|elementary particle]] physics.
