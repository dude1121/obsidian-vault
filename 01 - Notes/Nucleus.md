The **nucleus** is the centre of an [[Atom|atom]]. In almost all [[Element (Chemistry)|elements]] it contains both [[Proton|protons]] and [[Neutron|neutrons]]. When compared to the size of the atom as a whole, the nucleus is very small, however it makes up the majority of the mass of an atom since the orbiting [[Electron|electrons]] are nearly massless.

All particles within the nucleus are held together by the [[Strong Force|nuclear strong force]]. This strong force needs to be large enough to overcome the repellent [[Electromagnetic Force|electromagnetic force]] described by [[Coulomb's Law|Coulomb's law]], since all protons have like charges. At short ranges, this is the case. However, as more protons are added to the nucleus, the strong force begins to be overcome by the Coulomb force and the nucleus will split. This is evidenced by the fact that almost every [[Element (Chemistry)|element]] after [[Calcium|calcium]] has stable isotopes with more neutrons than protons, since the added neutrons help stabilize the atom by increasing the strong force.

This balancing act between the strong force and the electromagnetic force is referred to as *nuclear stability*.
