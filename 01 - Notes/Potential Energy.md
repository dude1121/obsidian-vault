**Potential energy** is a form of [[Energy|energy]] that is stored in an object depending on its location within a system. It is measured in [[Joule|joules]] $[\pu{ J}]$ and typically denoted with a $U$ or $V$. This energy gives the object the *potential* to move, i.e. to convert its stored potential energy into active [[Kinetic Energy|kinetic energy]]. Unlike kinetic energy however, potential energy does not have one set definition, as the meaning of potential energy depends largely on the system being described. For example, an object suspended in the air at rest has [[Gravity|gravitational]] potential energy, typically defined as
$$
U_{g}=mgy
$$
where $m$ is the object's mass, $g$ is the [[Acceleration|acceleration]] due to gravity, and $y$ is the object's height above the ground. When the object is released, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it enters free fall. Another example is an object attached to the end of a spring that has been extended. When the object is pulled away some distance $x$ from its equilibrium, its elastic potential energy is given by
$$
U_{s}=\frac{1}{2}kx^2
$$
where $k$ is the spring constant. A [[Charge|charged]] particle in an [[Electric Field|electric field]] also has potential energy the moment before the field force acts on the particle.

# Relation to conservative forces

A given [[Force|force]] is said to be [[Conservative Force|conservative]] if a potential energy can be defined for said force. In other words, a conservative force *necessarily* must be obtained by taking the [[Partial Derivative|derivatives with respect to each dimension]] of some function $U$. A conservative force can therefore be defined by,
$$
\mathbf{\vec{F}}=-\nabla U
$$
