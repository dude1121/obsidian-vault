An **isotope** of an atom is another atom with the same number of [[Proton|protons]] as the first but a different number of [[Neutron|neutrons]]. For example, [[Sodium|sodium]] only exists in one stable isotope with 12 neutrons in comparison to its 11 protons. We call this "Sodium-23" since its [[Mass Number|mass number]] is $23$ ($11+12$). We might denote this as
$$
\ce{^{23}_{11}Na}
$$
where the [[Atomic Number|atomic number]] $Z$ is written as a subscript and the mass number $A$ is a superscript.
