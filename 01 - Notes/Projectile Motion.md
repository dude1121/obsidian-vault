**Projectile motion** is a form of [[Motion|motion]] involving some sort of projectile (or, object) flying through the air, subject to [[Gravity|gravity]]. The path that the projectile takes is called its [[Trajectory|trajectory]]. Under some assumptions for basic projectile motion, we can assume this trajectory is always [[Parabola|parabolic]].

# Simple Projectile Motion

Simple projectile motion makes use of two assumptions:
1. The free-fall [[Acceleration|acceleration]] is constant over the range of motion and it is always directed downwards
2. The effect of [[Air Resistance|air resistance]] is negligible. 
Assumption 1 is justified so long as the range of motion is small compared to [[Earth|Earth's]] radius (~$6.4\times 10^{6}\pu{ m}$). Assumption 2 is rarely justifiable, especially at high [[Velocity|velocities]]. This assumption also does not take into account the effect of spin imparted on a projectile.

When analyzing simple projectile motion, we can assume it is a superposition of two different motions: [[Motion under Constant Velocity|motion of a particle under constant velocity]] in the horizontal direction and [[Motion under Constant Acceleration|motion of a particle under constant acceleration]] in the vertical direction.
