A **neutron** is a [[Subatomic Particle|subatomic particle]] that resides in the [[Nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[Atom|atom]]. It has slightly more mass than the [[Proton|proton]] with a mass of
$$
m_{n}=1.675\times 10^{-27}\ \pu{ kg}
$$
Unlike the proton and [[Electron|electron]], the neutron has no [[Charge|charge]], hence its name. The number of neutrons within an atom do not change the [[Element (Chemistry)|element]] nor the number of stable electrons, but it does change the [[Isotope|isotope]] of the atom. 

# Standard Model

According to the [[Standard Model of Physics|standard model]], the neutron is made up of three [[Quark|quarks]]: one [[Up (Quark)|up]] and two [[Down (Quark)|down]] quarks. The neutron, like the proton, is classified as both a [[Fermion|fermion]] and a [[Hadron|hadron]].
