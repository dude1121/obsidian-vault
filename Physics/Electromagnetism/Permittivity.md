**Permittivity** is a [[Units of Measurement|measure]] of a material's ability to "permit" the establishment of an [[Electric Field|electric field]] (not to be confused with [[Permeability]]). It can be measured in [[Farads]] per [[metre]] $[\text{F}/\text{m}]$ but a more general unit is [[Coulomb|Coulombs]] squared per [[Newton]]-metres squared $[\text{C}^2/\text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2]$. Most of the time, we use *relative permittivity*, $\epsilon_r$, which is a way of expressing the permittivity of a material with reference to "free space" permittivity, that is, the permittivity of a vacuum, $\epsilon_0$. 
$$
	\epsilon_0=8.854\times10^{-12}\text{ C}^2/\text{N}\text{m}^2
$$
Here is a table of commonly used permittivities: 

| **Dielectric**    | **$\epsilon_r$** | **Permittivity ($[\text{F}/\text{m}]$)**    |
