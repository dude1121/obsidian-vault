In mathematics, **summation** is the [[Addition|addition]] of a [[Sequence (Mathematics)|sequence]] of [[Number|numbers]]. The result of this process is the [[Sum|sum]]. In addition to numbers, [[Function|functions]], [[Vector|vectors]], [[Matrix|matrices]], and [[Polynomial|polynomials]] can be summed. 

Summation is often denoted with the symbol $\sum$. For example, the sum of all [[Natural Numbers|natural numbers]] from $1-100$ can be denoted as,
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{100}i
$$
$i$ is referred to as the *index of summation*. In this case, $1$ is the *lower bound of summation* and $100$ is the *upper bound of summation*. The $i=1$ means that the summation begins with $i$ having a value of $1$.

The terms can also have operations done to them, or even be functions. For example,
$$
\sum_{i=1}^4i^2=1+2^2+3^2+4^2=30
$$
Sometimes the bounds are omitted if the context is clear.
